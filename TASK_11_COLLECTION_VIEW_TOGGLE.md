# Task 11: Collection View Toggle Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the collection view toggle feature that allows users to switch between base card view and variants view in the collection screen. The implementation includes scroll position preservation, variant indicators, and comprehensive filtering options.

## Components Created

### 1. CollectionViewToggle Component (`src/client/components/CollectionViewToggle.tsx`)

A new component that provides:
- **View Mode Toggle**: Switch between "Base Cards" and "All Variants" views
- **Options Panel**: Collapsible settings panel with "Show unowned cards" checkbox
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear active state indicators with faction-themed colors
- **Mode Description**: Helpful text explaining the current view mode

**Features:**
- Amber-themed styling for base view
- Purple-themed styling for variants view
- Gear icon button to toggle options panel
- Smooth animations for panel expansion

### 2. CollectionViewMode Type

```typescript
interface CollectionViewMode {
  mode: 'base' | 'variants';
  showUnowned: boolean;
}
```

## CollectionScreen Enhancements

### New State Management

- **viewMode**: Tracks current view mode and showUnowned preference
- **scrollPositionRef**: Preserves scroll position when toggling views

### View Modes

#### Base View Mode
- Shows one entry per base card
- Displays variant badges (✨ count) for cards with alternate variants
- Badge shows total variant count including base
- Owned cards show colored badge, unowned show grayed badge
- Filters based on showUnowned preference

#### Variants View Mode
- Shows all variants as separate entries
- Each variant displays:
  - Variant name (e.g., "Standard", "Golden Edition")
  - Rarity-based color coding
  - Variant type badge (✨ for alternates)
  - Locked state for unowned variants
- Rarity colors:
  - Legendary: Orange
  - Epic: Purple
  - Rare: Blue
  - Common: Gray

### Scroll Position Preservation

Implemented `handleViewModeChange` function that:
1. Saves current scroll position before mode change
2. Updates view mode state
3. Restores scroll position after render
4. Provides seamless user experience when toggling

### Helper Functions

#### `isVariantOwned(variantId: string)`
Checks if a specific variant is owned by the player

#### `getVariantEntries()`
Generates list of variant entries for variants view:
- Iterates through filtered cards
- Fetches variants for each card
- Creates VariantCardEntry objects
- Applies showUnowned filter
- Handles cards without defined variants (creates default base variant)

## Card Components

### CollectionCard (Enhanced)
Updated for base view with variant indicators:
- Added `hasVariants` prop
- Added `variantCount` prop
- Displays variant badge in top-right corner
- Badge shows ✨ icon with count
- Different styling for owned vs unowned

### VariantCard (New)
Dedicated component for variants view:
- Shows variant-specific information
- Rarity-based color coding
- Variant type badge for alternates
- Locked state for unowned variants
- Displays variant name below card name

## Integration

### Updated Exports
Added to `src/client/components/index.ts`:
```typescript
export { CollectionViewToggle } from './CollectionViewToggle';
export type { CollectionViewMode } from './CollectionViewToggle';
```

### CollectionScreen Layout
1. Header with title and back button
2. **CollectionViewToggle** (new)
3. Filter tabs (All/White/Black)
4. Conditional rendering:
   - Base view: Grid of CollectionCard components
   - Variants view: Grid of VariantCard components

## Visual Design

### Toggle Component
- Two-button layout for view mode selection
- Gear icon button for options
- Collapsible options panel with fade-in animation
- Clear active state with border and shadow
- Descriptive text below buttons

### Variant Badges
- **Base View**: Purple badge with ✨ and count
- **Variants View**: Rarity-colored badges
- Positioned in top-right corner
- Semi-transparent background for readability

### Rarity System
Implemented visual hierarchy for variant rarities:
- **Legendary**: Orange (#f97316)
- **Epic**: Purple (#a855f7)
- **Rare**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Common**: Gray (#94a3b8)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **4.1**: Toggle between base and alternate design views
✅ **4.2**: Base view displays all base cards with variant indicators
✅ **4.3**: Alternate view displays all variants with ownership status
✅ **4.4**: Multiple alternate variants shown in alternate view
✅ **4.5**: Clear ownership indication for each variant
✅ **4.6**: Scroll position maintained when toggling views

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User clicks view mode button
2. `handleViewModeChange` saves scroll position
3. State updates trigger re-render
4. Appropriate view renders (base or variants)
5. Scroll position restored via setTimeout

### Variant Data Handling
- Uses `getVariantsByBaseCard` from variantUtils
- Falls back to default base variant if no variants defined
- Checks ownership via `isVariantOwned` helper
- Filters based on `showUnowned` preference

### Performance Considerations
- Variant entries computed only when in variants mode
- Scroll position preserved to avoid jarring UX
- Staggered animations for card grid (30ms delay per card)
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future tasks:
1. Persist view mode preference in localStorage
2. Add sorting options (rarity, name, level)
3. Implement variant preview on hover
4. Add variant comparison view
5. Include variant acquisition hints

## Testing Recommendations

1. **View Toggle**: Switch between base and variants views
2. **Scroll Preservation**: Scroll down, toggle view, verify position maintained
3. **Filter Interaction**: Test filters in both view modes
4. **Show Unowned**: Toggle checkbox and verify filtering
5. **Variant Badges**: Verify badges appear for cards with variants
6. **Rarity Colors**: Check color coding for different rarities
7. **Mobile**: Test touch targets and responsive layout
8. **Empty States**: Test with no variants defined

## Files Modified

1. `src/client/components/CollectionViewToggle.tsx` (new)
2. `src/client/components/index.ts` (updated exports)
3. `src/client/screens/CollectionScreen.tsx` (major enhancements)

## Build Status

✅ Client build successful
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ No linting issues

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Task 13: Update CollectionScreen with new card components
- Task 16: Create initial variant data
- Future variant selection and display features

The toggle system is fully functional and ready for integration with actual variant data when it becomes available.
