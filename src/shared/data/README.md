## Usage

Use the card catalog utilities from `src/shared/utils/cardCatalog.ts` to access and filter cards:

```typescript
import {
  loadCards,
  getCardById,
  filterCardsByLevel,
  filterCardsByFaction,
  getCardsUpToLevel,
} from '@/shared/utils/cardCatalog';

// Load all cards
const allCards = loadCards();

// Get specific card
const card = getCardById(101);

// Filter by level
const level5Cards = filterCardsByLevel(5);

// Get cards for gacha (up to player level)
const availableCards = getCardsUpToLevel(playerLevel);
```

## Validation

The card loader automatically validates all cards on load:

- Checks all required fields are present
- Validates faction values
- Validates level range (1-5)
- Validates ability values
- Ensures all IDs are unique

If validation fails, an error is thrown with details about invalid cards.
