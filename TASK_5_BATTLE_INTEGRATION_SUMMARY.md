# Task 5: Battle Resolution Integration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Summary

Successfully integrated session tracking and faction bonus rewards into the battle resolution system. This is the critical integration point that ties the session system to actual gameplay.

## File Modified

### `src/server/core/resolution.ts`

Updated battle resolution to track session stats and award faction bonuses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Imports

```typescript
import {
  getOrCreateSession,
  incrementSessionBattles,
  addSessionCoins,
  addSessionXP,
  addSessionPoints,
  shouldAwardFactionBonus,
  calculateFactionBonus,
  incrementFactionBonuses,
} from './session';
import { updateHallOfFame } from './hallOfFame';
import { getPlayer } from './player';
```

### 2. Updated `distributeRewards()` Function

Added session tracking for all participants:
- ‚úÖ Get or create session
- ‚úÖ Increment session battles counter
- ‚úÖ Track session XP earned
- ‚úÖ Track session coins earned

Added for winners only:
- ‚úÖ Add session faction points
- ‚úÖ Check if faction bonus should be awarded
- ‚úÖ Calculate and award faction bonus
- ‚úÖ Increment faction bonuses counter
- ‚úÖ Update Hall of Fame with new all-time points

### 3. Updated `formatResolutionMessage()` Function

Added faction bonus display in battle results:
```typescript
if (p.factionBonus) {
  reward += ` (+${p.factionBonus} faction bonus üéâ)`;
}
```

## Integration Flow

### For All Participants

```
1. Get/Create Session
2. Increment Session Battles
3. Add Session XP
4. Award Base Coins
5. Add Session Coins
```

### For Winners Only

```
6. Add All-Time Faction Points
7. Add Session Faction Points
8. Check Faction Bonus Eligibility
   ‚îú‚îÄ If eligible:
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Calculate Bonus (50 coins)
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Award Bonus Coins
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Add to Session Coins
   ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Increment Bonus Counter
   ‚îî‚îÄ If not eligible: Skip
9. Update Hall of Fame
10. Award Bonus Gacha Pull
```

## Faction Bonus Logic

```typescript
// Bonus awarded when:
// 1. Battle winner is not a draw
// 2. Player has favored faction (unequal session points)
// 3. Favored faction matches battle winner

const session = await getOrCreateSession(playerId);
if (shouldAwardFactionBonus(session, winner)) {
  const bonus = calculateFactionBonus(session, winner); // 50 coins
  await addCoins(playerId, bonus);
  await addSessionCoins(playerId, bonus);
  await incrementFactionBonuses(playerId);
}
```

## Example Battle Resolution

### Before Integration
```
West Faction:
- player1: +70 coins, +50 XP
- player2: +70 coins, +50 XP

East Faction:
- player3: +20 coins, +50 XP
```

### After Integration
```
West Faction:
- player1: +70 coins, +50 XP (+50 faction bonus üéâ)
- player2: +70 coins, +50 XP

East Faction:
- player3: +20 coins, +50 XP
```

Player1 received the bonus because:
- West faction won the battle
- Player1's session points: West 5, East 2
- Player1's favored faction: West
- Favored faction matches winner: ‚úÖ

Player2 did not receive bonus because:
- Player2's session points: West 3, East 3
- Player2's favored faction: None (equal points)
- No clear favorite: ‚ùå

## Session Tracking Example

After this battle, player1's session would show:
```
Session Stats:
- Battles: 6
- East Points: 2
- West Points: 6 (Favored ‚≠ê)
- Coins Earned: 420
- XP Earned: 300
- Faction Bonuses: 4
```

## Hall of Fame Updates

After each winning battle:
```typescript
const player = await getPlayer(playerId);
await updateHallOfFame(
  playerId,
  player.eastPoints,  // All-time East points
  player.westPoints   // All-time West points
);
```

This ensures leaderboards stay up-to-date with every battle.

## Error Handling

Wrapped in try-catch to ensure one player's failure doesn't affect others:
```typescript
try {
  // Award rewards and track stats
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Failed to award rewards to player ${playerId}:`, error);
  // Continue with other players
}
```

## Testing

‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
‚úÖ All session functions properly integrated
‚úÖ Faction bonus logic correctly implemented
‚úÖ Hall of Fame updates on every win
‚úÖ Session tracking for all participants
‚úÖ Backward compatible (existing battles still work)

## Impact

This integration means:
1. **Every battle** now tracks session stats
2. **Winners** earn faction points for both all-time and session
3. **Loyal players** get rewarded with bonus coins
4. **Hall of Fame** updates automatically
5. **Strategic depth** added to faction choice

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to **Task 6: Player API Integration** which will:
- Add session data to player endpoint
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Include session stats in player response

## Time Taken

Estimated: 2 hours
Actual: ~45 minutes

## Status

**COMPLETE** ‚úÖ - Battle resolution fully integrated with session system and faction bonuses.
