# Task 15: Battle View Variant Display - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented variant display in the BattleViewScreen, allowing players to see the card variants that other players selected for battle.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Type Updates (`src/shared/types/api.ts`)
- **Extended `BattleStateResponse`** to include `variantPreferences`:
  ```typescript
  export type BattleStateResponse = {
    battle: Battle;
    cards: { [cardId: number]: Card };
    variantPreferences: {
      [playerId: string]: {
        [cardId: number]: string; // Maps cardId to variantId
      };
    };
  };
  ```

### 2. Server-Side Updates (`src/server/index.ts`)
- **Modified `/api/battle/state` endpoint** to fetch variant preferences:
  - Collects all unique player IDs from battle slots
  - Fetches variant preferences for each player using `getAllVariantPreferences()`
  - Includes variant preferences in the API response
  
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Collect unique player IDs
  const playerIds = new Set<string>();
  for (const slot of allSlots) {
    if (slot) {
      playerIds.add(slot.playerId);
    }
  }

  // Fetch variant preferences for all players
  const variantPreferences: { [playerId: string]: { [cardId: number]: string } } = {};
  for (const playerId of playerIds) {
    const prefs = await getAllVariantPreferences(playerId);
    variantPreferences[playerId] = prefs;
  }
  ```

### 3. Client-Side Updates (`src/client/screens/BattleViewScreen.tsx`)

#### Component Structure Changes
- **Added imports**:
  - `GameCard` component for rendering cards with variants
  - `CardVariant` type from game types
  - `getVariantById` utility function

- **Added state management**:
  ```typescript
  const [variantPreferences, setVariantPreferences] = useState<{
    [playerId: string]: { [cardId: number]: string };
  }>({});
  ```

#### CardSlot Component Redesign
- **Updated props** to include optional `variant` parameter
- **Replaced custom card rendering** with `GameCard` component:
  - Uses `GameCard` with `size="thumbnail"` for consistent visual design
  - Maintains faction theming through GameCard's built-in theme system
  - Shows card artwork with proper variant selection

- **Added overlay system**:
  - Semi-transparent overlay displays current soldier count
  - Shows player ID below soldier count
  - Maintains dead card indicator with higher z-index

#### Helper Function
- **Created `getVariantForBattleCard()`**:
  ```typescript
  const getVariantForBattleCard = (battleCard: BattleCard | null): CardVariant | undefined => {
    if (!battleCard) return undefined;
    
    const playerPrefs = variantPreferences[battleCard.playerId];
    if (!playerPrefs) return undefined;
    
    const variantId = playerPrefs[battleCard.cardId];
    if (!variantId) return undefined;
    
    const variant = getVariantById(variantId);
    return variant || undefined;
  };
  ```

#### Rendering Updates
- **White faction slots**: Pass variant to each CardSlot
- **Black faction slots**: Pass variant to each CardSlot
- Variants are fetched per battle card and passed conditionally

## Visual Improvements

### Before
- Cards displayed with simple colored backgrounds
- Basic text-only display
- No visual distinction between variants

### After
- Cards display with full artwork (using GameCard component)
- Proper variant images shown based on player preferences
- Faction-themed styling maintained
- Semi-transparent overlays for battle-specific information
- Consistent visual design with other screens

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
- All variant handling uses proper TypeScript types
- Optional variant props handled correctly with conditional spreading
- No type errors or warnings

### Performance
- Variant preferences fetched once per battle load
- Efficient lookup using player ID and card ID mapping
- No unnecessary re-renders

### Fallback Behavior
- If no variant preference is set, GameCard displays base card
- If variant not found in registry, falls back gracefully
- Missing images handled by GameCard's built-in error handling

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 3.4**: Variant display persists throughout battle
- Variant preferences loaded with battle state
- Displayed consistently across all battle slots

✅ **Requirement 3.5**: Selected variants shown in battle view
- Players see the variants that were selected during battle creation
- Variant images and styling properly displayed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Variant Display**:
   - Join a battle with a card that has a selected variant
   - Verify the variant artwork displays correctly
   - Check that other players' variants also display

2. **Fallback Behavior**:
   - Test with cards that have no variant preference set
   - Verify base card displays correctly
   - Test with invalid variant IDs

3. **Visual Consistency**:
   - Compare card appearance with other screens (Collection, Gacha)
   - Verify faction theming is consistent
   - Check soldier count overlay is readable

4. **Performance**:
   - Test with full battles (20 cards)
   - Verify no lag when loading battle state
   - Check memory usage with multiple battles

## Integration Points

- **Works with Task 14**: Displays variants selected in BattleCreateScreen
- **Uses Task 8**: Leverages variant preference storage system
- **Uses Task 4**: Utilizes GameCard component for rendering
- **Uses Task 2**: Relies on variant utilities and asset resolver

## Future Enhancements

1. **Animation**: Add subtle animation when variant cards are placed
2. **Hover Details**: Show full card details on hover
3. **Variant Badge**: Add small indicator showing variant rarity
4. **Performance**: Consider lazy loading card images for large battles

## Conclusion

Task 15 is complete. The BattleViewScreen now properly displays selected card variants, providing visual consistency across the application and allowing players to showcase their preferred card artwork during battles.
