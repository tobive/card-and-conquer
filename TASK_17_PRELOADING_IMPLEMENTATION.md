# Task 17: Preloading Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented asset preloading across all relevant screens to ensure smooth user experience by loading card images before displaying content.

## Implementation Details

### 1. MenuScreen
**Preloading Strategy:**
- Preloads commonly used card thumbnails (Level 1 and 2 cards)
- These are the most frequently seen cards across the app
- Uses thumbnail size for performance

**Changes:**
- Added `useAssetPreloader` hook with level 1-2 card IDs
- Updated loading state to show "Loading assets..." while preloading
- Waits for both war status data and assets before rendering

### 2. GachaScreen
**Preloading Strategy:**
- Preloads full-size card images for gacha reveals
- Focuses on Level 1-3 cards (most common in gacha pulls)
- Uses full size for high-quality reveal animations

**Changes:**
- Added `useAssetPreloader` hook with level 1-3 card IDs
- Updated loading state to show "Loading card images..." while preloading
- Ensures smooth card reveal animations without loading delays

### 3. BattleCreateScreen
**Preloading Strategy:**
- Preloads full-size images of all cards in player's inventory
- Dynamically updates based on inventory contents
- Uses full size for card selection and preview

**Changes:**
- Added `useAssetPreloader` hook with inventory card IDs
- Uses `useMemo` to optimize card ID extraction
- Updated loading state to show "Loading card images..." while preloading
- Ensures smooth card selection and variant preview

### 4. BattleViewScreen
**Preloading Strategy:**
- Preloads full-size images of all cards in the battle
- Dynamically loads based on battle state
- Uses full size for battle display

**Changes:**
- Added `useAssetPreloader` hook with battle card IDs
- Uses `useMemo` to extract card IDs from cards object
- Updated loading state to show "Loading card images..." while preloading
- Ensures smooth battle visualization without image pop-in

### 5. BattleListScreen
**Preloading Strategy:**
- Preloads commonly used card thumbnails (Level 1-3 cards)
- Anticipates cards that might appear in battle previews
- Uses thumbnail size for performance

**Changes:**
- Added `useAssetPreloader` hook with level 1-3 card IDs
- Uses `useMemo` to optimize card filtering
- Updated loading state to show "Loading card images..." while preloading
- Ensures smooth battle list display

## Technical Implementation

### Asset Preloader Hook
The existing `useAssetPreloader` hook provides:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to placeholder images on failure
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and logging

### Preload Configuration
Each screen uses the `PreloadConfig` interface:
```typescript
{
  screen: string;           // Screen identifier for debugging
  assets: {
    cards: {
      ids: number[];        // Card IDs to preload
      size: 'full' | 'thumbnail';  // Image size
    };
  };
}
```

### Loading States
All screens now show appropriate loading messages:
- "Loading assets..." - While preloading images
- "Loading [data]..." - While fetching API data
- Smooth transition to content once both complete

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Selective Preloading**: Only preload cards likely to be displayed
2. **Size Optimization**: Use thumbnails for lists, full size for details
3. **Dynamic Loading**: BattleView and BattleCreate load based on actual data
4. **Memoization**: Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations

### Memory Management
- Preloader automatically handles cleanup on unmount
- Failed assets fall back to placeholders
- Progress tracking prevents memory leaks

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Implementation
- Cards would pop in as images loaded
- Janky scrolling during image loading
- Inconsistent loading times
- Poor experience on slow connections

### After Implementation
- Smooth, consistent loading experience
- Clear loading indicators
- No image pop-in or layout shifts
- Graceful fallbacks for failed loads
- Better experience on slow connections

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test each screen on slow network (throttle to 3G)
2. Verify loading indicators display correctly
3. Check that images don't pop in after screen loads
4. Test with failed image loads (404s)
5. Verify fallback placeholders work

### Performance Testing
1. Monitor memory usage with many cards
2. Check loading times on different connections
3. Verify no memory leaks on screen transitions
4. Test with large inventories (100+ cards)

### Edge Cases
1. Empty inventory (BattleCreate)
2. No battles (BattleList)
3. Network failures during preload
4. Missing card images
5. Rapid screen navigation

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Preload all required images before displaying screens
- All screens now preload relevant card images
- Loading indicators shown during preload

✅ **Requirement 5.6**: Display loading indicators while preloading
- Clear loading messages for each screen
- Progress tracked internally by preloader
- Smooth transition to content

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Progressive Loading**: Show content with placeholders, then swap in images
2. **Priority Loading**: Load visible cards first, then off-screen
3. **Cache Management**: Implement LRU cache for frequently used images
4. **Prefetching**: Preload next screen's assets in background
5. **Service Worker**: Cache assets for offline support

### Performance Monitoring
1. Add analytics for preload times
2. Track failed asset loads
3. Monitor memory usage patterns
4. Measure user-perceived performance

## Conclusion

All relevant screens now implement proper asset preloading with:
- Appropriate loading strategies per screen
- Clear loading indicators
- Graceful error handling
- Optimized performance
- Improved user experience

The implementation ensures smooth, professional-feeling transitions and eliminates jarring image pop-in effects throughout the application.
