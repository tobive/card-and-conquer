## Game Session System

### Overview

The game session system tracks your progress within a single "game" - a period of gameplay where you accumulate faction points and earn rewards based on your faction loyalty.

### How It Works

**Session Creation:**
- A new session is automatically created when you first log in
- Each session has a unique ID and start timestamp
- Sessions track per-game statistics separately from all-time stats

**Session Tracking:**
- **East Session Points**: Points earned for East faction this game
- **West Session Points**: Points earned for West faction this game
- **Battles This Session**: Number of battles participated in
- **Coins Earned This Session**: Total coins earned (including bonuses)
- **XP Earned This Session**: Total XP earned
- **Faction Bonuses Earned**: Number of faction bonus rewards received

**Favored Faction:**
- Your "favored faction" is the faction with more session points
- If East points > West points ‚Üí East is favored
- If West points > East points ‚Üí West is favored
- If points are equal ‚Üí No favored faction (Neutral)

**Session Completion:**
- You can complete your current game session at any time
- Completing a session shows a summary of your performance
- **Your level and XP reset to Level 1** for the new game
- A new session automatically starts after completion
- Session points reset to 0, but all-time stats are preserved
- Your collection and inventory remain unchanged

### Why Sessions Matter

Sessions add strategic depth by rewarding faction loyalty within each game. Players must decide whether to:
- Focus on one faction for maximum bonuses
- Balance both factions for flexibility
- Switch strategies between game sessions

## Faction Reward System

### Overview

The faction reward system gives bonus coins to players who support their favored faction in battles.

### Bonus Calculation

**When You Win a Battle:**

1. You earn 1 session point for your faction
2. The system checks your favored faction (highest session points)
3. If your favored faction matches the battle winner:
   - **You receive +500 bonus coins!** üéâ
4. If your favored faction doesn't match or you have no favorite:
   - No bonus (you still get normal battle rewards)

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Faction Bonus Earned**
```
Your Session Points: East 8, West 3
Your Favored Faction: East
Battle Outcome: East wins
Result: 70 coins + 50 XP + 500 BONUS coins = 570 total coins
```

**Scenario 2: No Bonus (Wrong Faction)**
```
Your Session Points: East 8, West 3
Your Favored Faction: East
Battle Outcome: West wins
Result: 70 coins + 50 XP (no bonus)
```

**Scenario 3: No Bonus (Equal Points)**
```
Your Session Points: East 5, West 5
Your Favored Faction: None (Neutral)
Battle Outcome: East wins
Result: 70 coins + 50 XP (no bonus)
```

**Scenario 4: First Battle of Session**
```
Your Session Points: East 0, West 0
Your Favored Faction: None yet
Battle Outcome: East wins
Result: 70 coins + 50 XP (no bonus this time)
Next Battle: East is now favored (1-0)
```

### Strategic Implications

**Faction Loyalty Strategy:**
- Stick with one faction per session to maximize bonuses
- Every win with your favored faction = +500 extra coins
- Over 10 battles, that's +5,000 bonus coins!

**Balanced Strategy:**
- Play both factions for flexibility
- Fewer bonuses but more battle opportunities
- Good for completing battles quickly

**Switching Strategy:**
- Start new sessions to change faction focus
- Useful if one faction is dominating the war
- Allows you to adapt to the meta

## Combat System

### Turn-Based Combat

When a card is placed in battle, it immediately fights a random enemy card using turn-based combat:

**Combat Phases:**

1. **Pre-Combat Phase**
   - Abilities that modify stats activate
   - Turn order determined
   - Max devotees calculated

2. **Combat Phase**
   - Cards alternate attacks
   - Each attack deals random damage (0 to max devotees)
   - Continues until one card reaches 0 devotees

3. **Post-Combat Phase**
   - Survival abilities check
   - Final damage abilities trigger
   - Combat result recorded

### Damage Calculation

**Base Damage:**
- Each attack deals random damage from 0 to the attacker's max devotees
- Example: A card with 500 devotees deals 0-500 damage per attack

**Ability Modifiers:**
- **Precision**: Minimum damage is 50% of max devotees
  - Example: 500 devotee card deals 250-500 damage (never less than 250)

### Combat Example

```
Attacker: Zeus (500 devotees, FirstStrike)
Defender: Odin (600 devotees, no ability)

Pre-Combat:
- Zeus has FirstStrike: 70% chance to go first ‚Üí Success!
- Turn order: Zeus attacks first

Combat:
Turn 1: Zeus attacks ‚Üí 342 damage ‚Üí Odin: 258 devotees
Turn 2: Odin attacks ‚Üí 189 damage ‚Üí Zeus: 311 devotees
Turn 3: Zeus attacks ‚Üí 401 damage ‚Üí Odin: -143 devotees (dead)

Result: Zeus wins with 311 devotees remaining
```

### Ability Reference

| Ability | Phase | Effect | Trigger Chance |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **FirstStrike** | Pre-Combat | Attack first | 70% |
| **Reinforcements** | Pre-Combat | +100 devotees if defending | 100% |
| **SiegeMaster** | Pre-Combat | +300 devotees in City/Fortress | 100% |
| **Spartan** | Pre-Combat | +200 devotees vs stronger foe | 100% |
| **Precision** | During Combat | Min 50% damage per attack | 100% |
| **TacticalRetreat** | Post-Combat | Survive with 1 devotee | 20% |
| **LastStand** | Post-Combat | Deal 1 final damage | 100% |

## Faction War System

### Global War Slider

The war slider represents the ongoing conflict between East and West factions:

**Slider Range:**
- -6 (East Victory) ‚Üê 0 (Neutral) ‚Üí +6 (West Victory)

**Slider Movement:**
- Each battle win moves the slider ¬±1 toward the winning faction
- West win: Slider moves +1 (toward West)
- East win: Slider moves -1 (toward East)
- Draw: Slider doesn't move

**War Victory:**
- When slider reaches ¬±6, that faction wins the war
- All players who fought for the winning faction receive +100 coins
- Victory announcement posted to Reddit
- Slider resets to 0 and a new war begins

### War Participation

**Tracking:**
- System tracks which players fought for each faction
- Only players who participated in battles are eligible for war rewards
- Rewards distributed automatically when war ends

**Strategy:**
- Join the winning side for war rewards
