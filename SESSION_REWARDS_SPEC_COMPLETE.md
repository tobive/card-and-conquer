- Added Hall of Fame explanation
- Added 3 new strategy tips

**GAME_MECHANICS.md** (New File)

- Combat system deep dive
- All game systems explained
- FAQ section
- 16 pages of detailed mechanics

**src/shared/types/README.md**
- Added session types documentation
- Added Hall of Fame types
- Updated API endpoints list

## How The System Works

### Game Session Flow

```
1. Player logs in â†’ Session auto-created
2. Player wins battle for East â†’ +1 East session point
3. Player wins battle for East â†’ +1 East point + 50 bonus coins (favored faction!)
4. Player wins battle for West â†’ +1 West point (no bonus)
5. Player completes session â†’ See summary, start fresh
6. Session points reset â†’ All-time points preserved
```

### Faction Bonus Logic

```
IF player wins battle:
  Add 1 session point for their faction
  
  IF player's favored faction (highest session points) == battle winner:
    Award +50 bonus coins ðŸŽ‰
  ELSE:
    No bonus (still get normal rewards)
```

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Maximizing Bonuses**
- Session: East 10, West 0
- Favored: East
- 10 East wins = 700 coins + 500 XP + 500 bonus coins = 1,200 total coins!

**Scenario 2: Balanced Play**
- Session: East 5, West 5
- Favored: None (equal)
- No bonuses awarded (still get normal rewards)

**Scenario 3: Switching Factions**
- Complete current session
- Start new session with 0 points
- Build up new favored faction

## Key Features

### 1. Per-Game Tracking
- Track East and West points separately each game
- Session stats: battles, coins, XP, bonuses
- Independent from all-time stats

### 2. Faction Bonuses
- +50 coins when favored faction wins
- Encourages strategic faction loyalty
- Can earn 500+ bonus coins per session

### 3. Hall of Fame
- Three leaderboards: East, West, Combined
- Top 100 players per leaderboard
- Based on all-time faction points
- Never resets - permanent legacy

### 4. Session Completion
- Manual completion anytime
- Shows performance summary
- Resets session points
- Preserves collection and all-time stats

## Technical Implementation

### New Modules
- `src/server/core/session.ts` - Session management
- `src/server/core/hallOfFame.ts` - All-time leaderboards

### Modified Systems
- Battle resolution - Add session tracking and bonuses
- Player API - Include session data
- Statistics - Include session stats

### New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/session` - Get current session
- `POST /api/session/complete` - Complete session
- `GET /api/hall-of-fame` - Get leaderboards

### New UI Components
- SessionStats - Display session progress
- FactionBonusNotification - Celebrate bonuses
- GameCompletionScreen - Show summary
- HallOfFameScreen - Display leaderboards

## Implementation Plan

### Sprint 1: Backend (12.5 hours)
- Session and Hall of Fame modules
- Battle resolution integration
- API endpoints
- Testing

### Sprint 2: Frontend (12.5 hours)
- React hooks for session/hall of fame
- UI components
- Menu integration
- Testing

### Sprint 3: Polish (10.5 hours)
- Player migration
- Battle UI updates
- Documentation
- Final testing

**Total: 35.5 hours**

## Strategic Benefits

### For Players
- **More Rewards**: Earn up to 500+ bonus coins per session
- **Strategic Depth**: Choose which faction to support
- **Long-Term Goals**: Hall of Fame provides permanent achievement
- **Flexibility**: Complete sessions to switch strategies

### For Game Design
- **Increased Engagement**: Players check stats before battles
- **Meaningful Choices**: Faction selection matters
- **Retention**: Hall of Fame provides long-term goals
- **Balanced**: Doesn't affect core gameplay, adds optional depth

## Migration & Compatibility

### Existing Players
- Sessions auto-created on login
- Start with 0 session points
- All-time points preserved
- No data loss

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing APIs work unchanged
- New fields added to responses
- Graceful degradation
