- [x] Consistent loading UX across all screens

## Requirements Verification

### ✅ Requirement 5.4: Preload all required images before displaying screens
**Status**: SATISFIED
- MenuScreen: Preloads common thumbnails
- GachaScreen: Preloads full-size images for reveals
- BattleCreateScreen: Preloads inventory card images
- BattleViewScreen: Preloads battle card images
- BattleListScreen: Preloads common thumbnails

### ✅ Requirement 5.6: Display loading indicators while preloading
**Status**: SATISFIED
- All screens show loading indicators
- Clear messages during preload phase
- Progress tracked by preloader hook
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks

## Build Verification

### ✅ TypeScript Compilation
- [x] No TypeScript errors in MenuScreen
- [x] No TypeScript errors in GachaScreen
- [x] No TypeScript errors in BattleCreateScreen
- [x] No TypeScript errors in BattleViewScreen
- [x] No TypeScript errors in BattleListScreen

### ✅ Build Success
- [x] Client build completes successfully
- [x] No build warnings related to preloading
- [x] Bundle size reasonable (355.61 kB)

## Code Quality

### ✅ Best Practices
- [x] Used existing `useAssetPreloader` hook
- [x] Proper TypeScript typing
- [x] Optimized with `useMemo` where appropriate
- [x] Consistent implementation across screens
- [x] Clear, descriptive loading messages

### ✅ Performance

- [x] Dynamic loading based on actual data
- [x] Memoization to prevent recalculations

### ✅ Error Handling
- [x] Retry logic in preloader
- [x] Fallback to placeholders
- [x] Error logging
- [x] Graceful degradation

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test MenuScreen on slow network
- [ ] Test GachaScreen card reveals
- [ ] Test BattleCreateScreen with large inventory
- [ ] Test BattleViewScreen with full battle
- [ ] Test BattleListScreen with multiple battles
- [ ] Verify no image pop-in on any screen
- [ ] Test with network failures
- [ ] Test with missing images

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Check loading times on 3G
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks
- [ ] Test rapid screen navigation
