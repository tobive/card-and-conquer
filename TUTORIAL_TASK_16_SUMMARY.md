## Implementation Overview

This task involved creating a comprehensive responsive design system for the tutorial, ensuring it works perfectly across all device sizes from 320px mobile phones to 1920px+ desktop monitors.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Comprehensive Responsive Breakpoint System

Implemented a mobile-first responsive design with 5 breakpoints:

- **Large Desktop** (1280px+): Optimized for large monitors
- **Small Mobile** (< 480px): Special handling for very small screens

### 2. Typography Scaling

Ensured readable text at all screen sizes:

| Screen Size | Base Font | H1 | H2 | H3 |
|-------------|-----------|----|----|-----|
| Mobile      | 14px      | 28px | 24px | 20px |
| Tablet      | 15px      | 32px | 28px | 24px |
| Desktop     | 16px      | 36px | 32px | 28px |
| Large       | 16px      | 40px | 36px | 28px |

- Simplified transitions (0.2s max)

#### Touch Device Optimizations
- touch-action: manipulation for better responsiveness
- Tap highlight color removed
- Scale feedback on touch (0.98)
