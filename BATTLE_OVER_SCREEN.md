# Battle Over Screen Implementation

## Overview
Added a dedicated "Battle Over" screen that displays when users click on a resolved battle post. Previously, clicking on a completed battle would just show the main page without any indication that the battle had ended.

## Changes Made

### BattleViewScreen.tsx
Added a new screen that displays when viewing a resolved battle (status: Completed or Stalemate):

**Features:**
- **Clear Status Display**: Shows "Battle Over" with appropriate emoji (üèÜ for victory, ‚öîÔ∏è for draw)
- **Winner Announcement**: Displays which faction won or if it was a draw
- **Encouraging Message**: Motivates users to create new battles or join active ones
- **Action Buttons**:
  - "Go to Main Menu" - Returns to the main menu
  - "View Active Battles" - Navigates to the battle list to find active battles

**Visual Design:**
- Large animated emoji for visual impact
- Color-coded borders (amber for victories, slate for draws)
- Info card explaining the battle is over with suggestions
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## User Experience

### Before
- Clicking on a resolved battle post ‚Üí Shows main page (confusing)
- No indication that the battle was over
- Users had to figure out why they couldn't join

### After
- Clicking on a resolved battle post ‚Üí Shows dedicated "Battle Over" screen
- Clear message that the battle has concluded
- Winner is displayed prominently
- Encouragement to create new battles or join others
- Easy navigation to main menu or active battles

## Technical Details

The screen checks if:
1. Battle status is `Completed` or `Stalemate`
2. The battle result modal is not currently showing (to avoid showing both)

This ensures the screen only appears when viewing an already-resolved battle, not when witnessing a battle resolve in real-time (which uses the existing modal).

## Testing

To test this feature:
1. Create a battle and let it resolve (complete all slots and wait for combat)
2. Navigate away from the battle
3. Click on the resolved battle post again
4. You should see the "Battle Over" screen with winner information and navigation options
