# Battle Completion Improvements

## Two Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Battle Over Screen with Main Menu Button

**Problem**: When viewing a completed battle, players couldn't easily return to the main menu.

**Solution**: Enhanced the Battle Result Modal with two buttons:
- "Go to Main Menu" - Returns to main menu (primary action)
- "View Battle" - Closes modal to view final battle state (secondary action)

**Implementation**:
- Updated `BattleResultModal` in `BattleViewScreen.tsx`
- Added two-button layout with clear hierarchy
- Primary button goes to menu, secondary button shows battle

**User Experience**:
- Modal shows immediately when loading completed battle
- Clear call-to-action to return to menu
- Option to view final battle state if desired
- Works for victories, defeats, and draws

**Files Modified**: `src/client/screens/BattleViewScreen.tsx`

### 2. ‚úÖ Auto-Resolve Comment Posting

**Problem**: When battles auto-resolve via scheduler (30-minute timeout), no comment was posted to inform players.

**Solution**: Scheduler now posts a resolution comment with winner and stats.

**Implementation**:
- Updated `resolvePendingBattles()` in `battleScheduler.ts`
- After successful resolution, posts comment to battle post
- Uses existing `formatResolutionMessage()` for consistent formatting
- Error handling ensures comment failure doesn't break resolution

**Comment Format** (from `formatResolutionMessage`):
```
üèÜ BATTLE RESOLVED! üèÜ

Winner: West Faction
Final Devotee Count:
- West: 1,234 devotees
- East: 987 devotees

Participants: 15 warriors
Total Rewards Distributed: 1,050 coins, 750 XP

[Additional details about faction bonuses, war impact, etc.]
```

**When Comments Are Posted**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-resolve via scheduler (every 5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Manual join that triggers resolution
- ‚úÖ Battle fills up (20/20 slots)
- ‚úÖ 30-minute timeout

**Files Modified**: `src/server/core/battleScheduler.ts`

## Benefits

### For Players
1. **Clear Closure**: Know immediately when battle is over
2. **Easy Navigation**: One click to return to menu
3. **Transparency**: See resolution details in Reddit comments
4. **Notifications**: Reddit notifies participants of new comments

### For Game Health
1. **Better UX**: No confusion about battle status
2. **Engagement**: Players can see results without opening app
3. **Community**: Resolution comments create discussion
4. **Transparency**: All resolutions are publicly logged

## Technical Details

### Battle Result Modal
**Location**: `src/client/screens/BattleViewScreen.tsx`

**Triggers**:
- Battle status is `Completed` or `Stalemate`
- Shows automatically on battle load
- Can be dismissed to view battle

**Buttons**:
```typescript
<Button onClick={() => navigate('menu')} variant="primary">
  Go to Main Menu
</Button>
<Button onClick={() => setBattleResult({ winner: '', show: false })} variant="secondary">
  View Battle
</Button>
```

### Comment Posting
**Location**: `src/server/core/battleScheduler.ts`

**Process**:
1. Scheduler checks battles every 5 minutes
2. Resolves battles meeting criteria
3. Posts comment with resolution details
4. Logs success/failure

**Error Handling**:
- Comment failure doesn't break resolution
- Errors logged for debugging
- Resolution still completes successfully
