# Card Consumption System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

The card consumption system has been fully implemented. Cards are now consumable resources with quantities that decrease when used in battles. This adds strategic depth and resource management to the game.

## System Design

### Previous System
- Cards were permanent once unlocked
- Could be used unlimited times
- No resource management needed

### New System
- Each card has a **quantity** (number of copies owned)
- Cards are **consumed** when placed in battles
- Players must **collect more copies** through gacha
- Adds **strategic resource management**

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Inventory System (`src/server/core/inventory.ts`)

**Data Structure:**
- Uses Redis hash: `inventory:username` → `{cardId:variantId: quantity}`
- Each variant of a card tracks its own quantity
- Example: `"1:1-base": "5"` means 5 copies of Zeus base variant

**Key Functions:**
```typescript
// Add card (increments quantity)
addCardToInventory(username, cardId, variantId)

// Get all inventory items with quantities
getInventoryItems(username): Promise<InventoryItem[]>

// Get full card objects with quantities
getInventoryCards(username): Promise<Array<Card & { quantity: number }>>

// Check if card is available
hasCardVariantAvailable(username, cardId, variantId): Promise<boolean>

// Get quantity of specific variant
getCardVariantQuantity(username, cardId, variantId): Promise<number>

// Consume card (decrements quantity)
removeCardFromInventory(username, cardId, variantId): Promise<void>
```

**Quantity Tracking:**
- Base variants and alternate variants tracked separately
- Each variant has its own quantity counter
- Quantity of 0 removes the entry from inventory
- Aggregation functions calculate total quantities

#### 2. Battle System (`src/server/core/battle.ts`)

**Battle Creation:**
```typescript
// In createBattle()
1. Check if player has the card available
2. Consume the card from inventory
3. Create the battle with the card
4. If any step fails, throw error
```

**Battle Joining:**
```typescript
// In addCardToBattle()
1. Validate card exists in catalog
2. Check if player has the card available
3. Find empty slot in appropriate faction
4. Consume the card from inventory
5. Add card to battle
```

**Error Handling:**
- "You do not have this card in your inventory" - Card not available
- "{faction} faction slots are full" - No empty slots
- "Card not found" - Invalid card ID

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Collection Screen (`src/client/screens/CollectionScreen.tsx`)

**Quantity Display:**
- **Base View**: Shows total quantity across all variants (bottom-left badge)
- **Variants View**: Shows per-variant quantity (top-left badge)
- **Format**: `×N` where N is the quantity
- **Style**: Amber text on dark background with border

**Helper Functions:**
```typescript
// Get total quantity for a base card (all variants)
getCardTotalQuantity(cardId): number

// Get quantity for specific variant
getVariantQuantity(variantId): number
```

**Visual Design:**
```tsx
{/* Quantity Badge */}
{quantity > 0 && (
  <div className="absolute bottom-1 left-1 bg-slate-900/90 rounded px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] text-amber-400 font-bold shadow-lg z-10 border border-amber-400/30">
    ×{quantity}
  </div>
)}
```

#### 2. Battle Screens

**BattleCreateScreen:**
- Sends `variantId` when creating battle
- Only shows cards that are available (quantity > 0)
- Uses player's preferred variant or base variant

**BattleViewScreen:**
- Displays cards with their selected variants
- Fetches variant preferences from player data
- Shows cards as they were placed in battle

### API Changes

**Endpoints Updated:**
```typescript
// Battle creation now accepts variantId
POST /api/battle/start
Body: { initialCardId, variantId?, mapType }

// Battle join now accepts variantId
POST /api/battle/join
Body: { battleId, cardId, variantId? }

// Inventory response includes quantities
GET /api/player/inventory
Response: { cards: Array<Card & { variantId, quantity }> }
```

## Data Migration

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old format: `"1"` (just cardId) → Treated as `"1:1-base"` with quantity 1
- New format: `"1:1-base": "5"` → 5 copies of Zeus base variant
- System handles both formats automatically
- Existing players keep all their cards
- Quantities calculated from existing entries

**No Migration Needed:**
- System is backward compatible
- Old inventory entries work with new system
- Quantities auto-calculated from existing data

## Testing Guide

See `CARD_CONSUMPTION_TESTING.md` for detailed testing steps.

**Quick Test:**
1. Open Collection → Note a card's quantity (e.g., Zeus ×3)
2. Create Battle → Use that card
3. Return to Collection → Verify quantity decreased (×3 → ×2)
4. Use last copy → Verify card disappears or shows as unowned
5. Try to use again → Verify error message appears

## Strategic Impact

### Gameplay Changes

**Resource Management:**
- Players must manage their card inventory
- Can't spam the same powerful card repeatedly
- Must balance using cards vs saving them

**Gacha Value:**
- Duplicate cards are now valuable
- Multiple copies needed for sustained play
- Encourages more gacha pulls

**Strategic Depth:**
- Choose which cards to use in which battles
- Save powerful cards for important battles
- Build diverse collection for flexibility

**Faction Balance:**
- Can't dominate with single overpowered card
- Must collect cards from both factions
- Encourages balanced gameplay

### Economic Impact

**Increased Engagement:**
- Players need to return to collect more cards
- Creates gameplay loop: battle → run out → gacha → battle
- More meaningful progression

**Monetization Potential:**
- Paid gacha pulls more valuable
- Multi-pulls more attractive
- Card bundles could be offered
