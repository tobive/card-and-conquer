## CSS Architecture

### Organization
1. Base styles and resets
2. Faction color definitions

5. Mobile responsive styles
6. Accessibility and preference queries

### Performance Considerations
- GPU acceleration for animations
- Will-change properties for frequently animated elements
- Reduced animation complexity on mobile
- Optimized scrollbar styling
- Hardware-accelerated transforms

### Browser Compatibility
- Webkit prefixes for iOS Safari
- Standard CSS properties for modern browsers
- Fallbacks for older browsers
- Safe area inset support for notched devices

## Testing Recommendations

4. ✅ Test landscape orientation
5. ✅ Test on notched devices (safe area insets)

### Interaction Testing
1. ✅ Test bonus pull button hover/active states
2. ✅ Test stat item hover effects

## Files Modified
- `src/client/index.css` - Comprehensive CSS updates

## Next Steps
1. Test the styling in the browser with `npm run dev`
2. Verify faction colors match the mythological theme
3. Test bonus gacha UI interactions
4. Test statistics screen on various devices
5. Verify loading spinners appear correctly
6. Test mobile responsiveness on actual devices
7. Proceed to Task 15: Testing and verification

## Notes
- All CSS changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Legacy faction classes (white/black) are mapped to new East/West colors
- Mobile optimizations prioritize performance over visual complexity
- Accessibility features ensure the app is usable by all users
- The styling creates a cohesive mythological theme throughout the app
