# Task 12: Gacha Variant Reveal Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the GachaScreen to display variant information in reveal modals with special visual effects for alternate variants, rarity-based color schemes, and "NEW VARIANT!" badges.

## Changes Made

### 1. GachaScreen Component Updates

#### Added Variant State Management
- Added `VariantInfo` type for variant data structure
- Updated state to track `revealedVariant` alongside `revealedCard`
- Added `isNewVariant` state to track first-time alternate variant pulls
- Updated `multiPullCards` to include variant information for each card

#### Updated Pull Handlers
- Modified `handlePull` to extract variant info from API response
- Added logic to detect alternate variants and set `isNewVariant` flag
- Updated `handleMultiPull` to include variant data in multi-pull cards array
- Enhanced `closeReveal` to reset variant-related state

### 2. CardRevealModal Enhancements

#### Variant Information Display
- Added variant name and rarity display for alternate variants
- Positioned variant info prominently at the top of the card display
- Applied rarity-based color schemes (legendary=orange, epic=purple, rare=blue, common=slate)

#### Special Visual Effects
- **Particle Effects**: Added 20 floating particles for alternate variants
  - Particles use rarity-based colors
  - Random positioning and animation delays for natural effect
  - Radial gradient for glow appearance
- **Glow Animation**: Applied `animate-pulse-glow` class to alternate variant cards
- **Rarity-Based Shadows**: Different shadow colors based on variant rarity

#### NEW VARIANT Badge
- Added prominent badge for first-time alternate variant pulls
- Positioned at top center with bounce animation
- Gradient background (purple to pink) with yellow border
- Only displays when `isNewVariant` is true

#### Enhanced Header
- Changed emoji from ðŸŽ‰ to âœ¨ for alternate variants
- Updated header text to "Alternate Variant!" for alternates
- Applied rarity-based colors to header text

### 3. MultiCardRevealModal Enhancements

#### Similar Variant Display
- Added variant name and rarity display
- Implemented same particle effects as single reveal
- Applied rarity-based color schemes

#### ALTERNATE VARIANT Badge
- Added badge for alternate variants in multi-pulls
- Positioned at top center (non-bouncing for multi-card flow)
- Same styling as NEW VARIANT badge

#### Enhanced Visual Effects
- Particle effects with 15 particles (slightly fewer for performance)
- Pulse-glow animation for alternate variants
- Rarity-based shadows and colors

#### Updated Button Styling
- Gradient button for alternate variants (purple to pink)
- Standard purple button for base variants
- Maintains "Next Card â†’" and "Awesome! ðŸŽ‰" text based on position

### 4. CSS Animations

#### New Animation: pulseGlow
```css
@keyframes pulseGlow {
  0%, 100% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(192, 132, 252, 0.5),
                0 0 40px rgba(192, 132, 252, 0.3),
                inset 0 0 20px rgba(192, 132, 252, 0.1);
  }
  50% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(192, 132, 252, 0.8),
                0 0 80px rgba(192, 132, 252, 0.5),
                inset 0 0 30px rgba(192, 132, 252, 0.2);
  }
}
```

#### Added Class
- `.animate-pulse-glow`: Applies pulsing glow effect with 2s infinite animation

## Visual Features

### Rarity Color Scheme
- **Legendary**: Orange (#fb923c) - Most rare and prestigious
- **Epic**: Purple (#c084fc) - Very rare
- **Rare**: Blue (#60a5fa) - Uncommon
- **Common**: Slate (#94a3b8) - Standard

### Particle Effects
- Floating particles with random positioning
- Rarity-based colors matching the variant
- Smooth animation with varying delays and durations
- Non-interactive (pointer-events: none)

### Glow Effects
- Pulsing glow animation for alternate variants
- Rarity-based shadow colors
- Multiple shadow layers for depth

### Badge Styling
- Gradient background for visual appeal
- Border for definition
- Bounce animation for NEW VARIANT
- Static positioning for ALTERNATE VARIANT in multi-pulls

## User Experience

### Single Pull Flow
1. Player performs gacha pull
2. If alternate variant: particles appear, card glows, "NEW VARIANT!" badge shows
3. Variant name and rarity displayed prominently
4. Rarity-based colors throughout the modal
5. Enhanced visual feedback for special pulls

### Multi-Pull Flow
1. Player performs 5-card pull
2. Each card revealed sequentially
3. Alternate variants highlighted with "ALTERNATE VARIANT" badge
4. Particles and glow effects for each alternate
5. Progress indicator shows position in sequence
6. Gradient button for alternate variants

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 6.4
âœ… When viewing gacha results THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate if a card is an alternate design variant
- Variant name and rarity displayed
- "ALTERNATE VARIANT" badge shown
- Visual distinction through colors and effects

### Requirement 6.5
âœ… When an alternate design is obtained THEN the system SHALL add it to the player's inventory as a separate entity from the base card
- Variant information passed through from API
- Separate tracking maintained in reveal modals
- Variant ID used for inventory management

## Technical Details

### Type Safety
- Added `VariantInfo` interface for type-safe variant data
- Updated modal props to include variant information
- Proper typing for rarity and variant type checks

### Performance Considerations
- Particle count limited (20 for single, 15 for multi)
- CSS animations use GPU acceleration
- Conditional rendering of effects only for alternate variants

### Accessibility
- Text remains readable with proper contrast
- Animations can be disabled via prefers-reduced-motion
- Clear visual hierarchy for variant information

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single Pull Testing**
   - Test pulling base variants (should show standard reveal)
   - Test pulling alternate variants (should show enhanced effects)
   - Verify "NEW VARIANT!" badge appears for first-time alternates
   - Check rarity colors for different variant rarities

2. **Multi-Pull Testing**
   - Test 5-card pull with mix of base and alternate variants
   - Verify alternate variants are highlighted in sequence
   - Check particle effects don't overlap or cause performance issues
   - Ensure progress indicator works correctly

3. **Visual Testing**
   - Verify particle animations are smooth
   - Check glow effects are visible but not overwhelming
   - Ensure badges are positioned correctly
   - Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

4. **Edge Cases**
   - All 5 cards are alternates
   - No alternates in multi-pull
   - Legendary rarity variants
   - Common rarity variants

## Next Steps

This task is complete. The next task (Task 13) will integrate these enhanced reveal modals into the CollectionScreen with the new GameCard/CardThumbnail components and collection view toggle.

## Files Modified

1. `src/client/screens/GachaScreen.tsx` - Enhanced reveal modals with variant information and effects
2. `src/client/index.css` - Added pulseGlow animation and animate-pulse-glow class
