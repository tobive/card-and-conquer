# Task 6: Bonus Gacha System Backend Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete bonus gacha system backend that rewards players with faction-specific gacha pulls when they win battles.

## Implementation Details

### 6.1 Bonus Gacha Core Module (`src/server/core/bonusGacha.ts`)

Created a new core module with the following functions:

- **`addBonusGachaPull(username, faction)`**: Awards a bonus pull for a specific faction when a player wins a battle
- **`getBonusGachaStatus(username)`**: Retrieves the current bonus pull status including:
  - `eastPulls`: Number of available East faction pulls
  - `westPulls`: Number of available West faction pulls
  - `totalEarned`: Total bonus pulls earned across all time
  - `lastUpdated`: Timestamp of last update
- **`useBonusGachaPull(username, faction)`**: Consumes a bonus pull and returns a random card from the specified faction only

**Key Features:**
- Faction-specific card pools (only East or West cards)
- Weighted random selection (same as regular gacha)
- Variant support (base and alternate variants)
- Redis storage with hash structure: `bonusGacha:{username}`

### 6.2 Battle System Integration (`src/server/core/resolution.ts`)

Integrated bonus gacha rewards into the battle resolution system:

- Added import for `addBonusGachaPull` function
- Modified `distributeRewards()` function to award bonus pulls to winners
- Bonus pulls are awarded only to players on the winning faction (not on draws)
- Awards happen automatically when battles are resolved

**Reward Flow:**
1. Battle completes (full slots or timeout)
2. Winner is determined
3. All participants receive coins and XP
4. Winners additionally receive:
   - Faction points
   - Leaderboard update
   - **Bonus gacha pull for their faction** ✨

### 6.3 API Endpoints (`src/server/index.ts`)

Created two new REST API endpoints:

#### GET `/api/bonus-gacha/status`
- Returns current bonus pull status for authenticated user
- Response includes pulls available for each faction
- No parameters required

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  eastPulls: number,
  westPulls: number,
  totalEarned: number,
  lastUpdated: number
}
```

#### POST `/api/bonus-gacha/pull`
- Uses a bonus pull for the specified faction
- Validates faction parameter (must be "East" or "West")
- Validates pull availability
- Returns the pulled card with variant and remaining pulls

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  faction: "East" | "West"
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  card: Card,
  variant: CardVariant,
  remainingPulls: number,
  player: Player
}
```

### Type Definitions (`src/shared/types/api.ts`)

Added new API response types:
- `BonusGachaStatusResponse`
- `BonusGachaPullRequest`
- `BonusGachaPullResponse`

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **4.1**: Players earn bonus pulls when winning battles for their faction  
✅ **4.2**: Bonus pulls are faction-specific (East or West)  
✅ **4.3**: Gacha screen can display available bonus pulls  
✅ **4.4**: Bonus pulls give random cards from specific faction only  
✅ **4.5**: Pull count decrements correctly  
✅ **4.6**: Bonus pulls persist across sessions (Redis storage)  
✅ **4.7**: Clear distinction between regular and bonus pulls via API

## Data Storage

**Redis Key:** `bonusGacha:{username}`

**Fields:**
- `eastPulls`: Number of available East faction pulls
- `westPulls`: Number of available West faction pulls
- `totalEarned`: Cumulative total of all bonus pulls earned
- `lastUpdated`: Timestamp of last modification

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Win a battle** and verify bonus pull is awarded
2. **Check status endpoint** to see available pulls
3. **Use a bonus pull** and verify:
   - Card is from correct faction
   - Pull count decrements
   - Variant is properly assigned
4. **Test with zero pulls** to ensure proper error handling
5. **Test invalid faction** parameter to ensure validation works

## Next Steps

The backend is complete. Next tasks should focus on:
- Task 7: Implement bonus gacha UI components
- Task 8: Implement user statistics system backend
- Task 9: Implement user statistics UI

## Files Modified

- ✅ Created: `src/server/core/bonusGacha.ts`
- ✅ Modified: `src/server/core/resolution.ts`
- ✅ Modified: `src/server/index.ts`
- ✅ Modified: `src/shared/types/api.ts`

All files pass TypeScript diagnostics with no errors.
