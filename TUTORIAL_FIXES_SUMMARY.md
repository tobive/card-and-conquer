# Tutorial System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Battle Layout - 10 Cards Horizontal
**Problem:** Battle grid was showing cards in 5×2 layout (5 columns, 2 rows) which appeared vertically stacked on some displays.

**Solution:** Changed to `grid-cols-10` with all 10 cards in a single horizontal row.

**Changes:**
- Updated `BattleMechanicsPage.tsx` battlefield layout
- Changed from `grid-cols-5` to `grid-cols-10`
- Added `min-w-[600px]` to ensure horizontal scrolling on small screens
- Reduced gap sizes for better fit
- Made faction labels more compact

**Result:**
```
West: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] ← 10 cards horizontal
East: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] ← 10 cards horizontal
```

### 2. ✅ Real Card Examples Added

**Card Collection Page:**
- Added real GameCard components for Level 1, 3, and 5 examples
- Cards: Hotei (Lvl 1), Hanuman (Lvl 3), Amaterasu (Lvl 5)
- Shows actual card images with stats
- Compact 3-column grid layout

**Card Abilities Page:**
- Added real GameCard components showing cards with different abilities
- Cards: Zeus (FirstStrike), Athena (Reinforcements), Poseidon (Precision)
- Shows actual card images with ability names
- Compact 3-column grid layout

### 3. ✅ Scroll Position Fixed
**Problem:** Scroll position was in the middle when navigating between pages.

**Solution:** Updated scroll reset logic in `TutorialScreen.tsx`
- Changed from `behavior: 'smooth'` to `behavior: 'auto'` for instant scroll
- Added scroll reset for main content area
- Scrolls to top immediately when page changes

**Code:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Scroll the main content area to top
  const mainContent = document.querySelector('main');
  if (mainContent) {
    mainContent.scrollTop = 0;
  }
  // Also scroll window to top
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'auto' });
}, [currentPage]);
```

### 4. ✅ Reduced Text and Icon Sizes
**Problem:** Large text and icons made pages too long, requiring excessive scrolling.

**Solution:** Reduced sizes throughout tutorial pages for better information density.

**Changes:**
- **Page titles:** 5xl/6xl → 3xl/4xl
- **Section headings:** 2xl/3xl → base/lg or lg/xl
- **Body text:** base/lg → xs/sm
- **Icons:** 5xl/6xl → 3xl/4xl or smaller
- **Spacing:** Reduced from space-y-8 → space-y-3/4
- **Card padding:** Reduced from p-6/8 → p-3/4

**Result:** Users can see more content in one viewport before needing to scroll.
