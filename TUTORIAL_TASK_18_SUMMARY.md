# Tutorial Task 18 Summary: Menu Integration

## Task Completion

**Task:** Integrate tutorial with main menu  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Tutorial Button in MenuScreen

Added a "How to Play" button to the main menu that allows users to access the tutorial system at any time.

**Key Features:**
- **Icon:** ðŸ“– (book emoji) - clear and recognizable
- **Title:** "How to Play"
- **Description:** "Learn game mechanics"
- **Styling:** Consistent with other secondary action buttons
- **Position:** In the action grid, after Hall of Fame
- **Animation:** Staggered fade-in with 700ms delay

### 2. Navigation Integration

The tutorial is fully integrated with the app's navigation system:

**Forward Navigation (Menu â†’ Tutorial):**
```typescript
<ActionButton
  onClick={() => navigate('tutorial')}
  title="How to Play"
  description="Learn game mechanics"
  icon="ðŸ“–"
  variant="secondary"
  delay={700}
/>
```

**Return Navigation (Tutorial â†’ Menu):**
- Done button on last page: Returns to menu
- Close button (X) in header: Returns to menu at any time

### 3. Route Configuration

The 'tutorial' route is properly configured in the RouterContext:

```typescript
export type Route =
  | 'welcome'
  | 'menu'
  | 'collection'
  | 'gacha'
  | 'battle-list'
  | 'battle-view'
  | 'battle-create'
  | 'leaderboard'
  | 'user-stats'
  | 'hall-of-fame'
  | 'tutorial';  // Tutorial route
```

### 4. App Routing

The TutorialScreen is rendered when the route is 'tutorial':

```typescript
case 'tutorial':
  return <TutorialScreen />;
```
