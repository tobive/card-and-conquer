# Task 2: Mythological Theme Data Verification

## Summary

Successfully verified and updated the card data JSON and related code to use the mythological theme with devotees and East/West factions.

## Card Data Verification

### JSON Structure ✅
- **File**: `src/shared/data/cards.json`
- **Total Cards**: 200 (100 East, 100 West)
- **Format**: Correct mythological theme format

### Sample Card Structure
```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Amaterasu",
  "faction": "East",
  "level": 5,
  "devotees": 436800,
  "ability": "FirstStrike",
  "description": "From her celestial throne in Takamagahara..."
}
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Uses "devotees" instead of "soldiers"
- ✅ Uses "East" and "West" factions (not White/Black)
- ✅ Mythological god names (Amaterasu, Zeus, Odin, etc.)
- ✅ Mythological descriptions appropriate to each pantheon
- ✅ Balanced distribution: 100 East cards, 100 West cards

## Code Updates

### 1. Card Interface (`src/shared/types/game.ts`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed `parody: string` field (not in JSON data)
- ✅ Already uses `devotees: number` (correct)
- ✅ Already uses `Faction.East` and `Faction.West` (correct)

### 2. Card Catalog (`src/shared/utils/cardCatalog.ts`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed validation for `card.parody` (line 18)
- ✅ Updated validation from `card.soldiers` to `card.devotees` (line 21)
- ✅ Updated `getCardCountByFaction()` to use `Faction.East` and `Faction.West` instead of `Faction.White` and `Faction.Black`

### 3. Validation Utilities (`src/shared/utils/validation.ts`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed `parody` validation from `isValidCard()` function
- ✅ Renamed `isValidSoldierCount()` to `isValidDevoteeCount()`
- ✅ Updated parameter from `soldiers` to `devotees`

## Verification Results

### TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ No diagnostic errors in `src/shared/types/game.ts`
- ✅ No diagnostic errors in `src/shared/utils/cardCatalog.ts`
- ✅ No diagnostic errors in `src/shared/utils/validation.ts`

### Data Integrity
- ✅ All 200 cards loaded successfully
- ✅ Faction distribution: 50/50 split (100 East, 100 West)
- ✅ All cards have required fields: id, name, faction, level, devotees, ability, description

## Requirements Met

### Requirement 1.4 ✅
> WHEN the card catalog is loaded THEN it SHALL use the new JSON format with "devotees" instead of "followers"

**Status**: Complete
- Card JSON uses "devotees" field
- Card interface uses "devotees" field
- Validation functions updated to check "devotees"

### Requirement 1.5 ✅
> WHEN faction themes are displayed THEN they SHALL reflect mythological aesthetics appropriate to each pantheon

**Status**: Complete
- All 200 cards have mythological god names
- Descriptions reflect Eastern and Western mythological themes
- Factions properly labeled as "East" and "West"

## Next Steps

The card data is now ready for use with the mythological theme. The next tasks will focus on:
1. Creating image utility functions for JPG format (Task 3)
2. Updating image components to use JPG format (Task 4)
3. Implementing lazy loading with visual feedback (Task 5)

## Notes

- No hardcoded card references were found that needed updating
- The card data was already in the correct format from a previous update
- Only the type definitions and validation code needed to be aligned with the JSON data
