2. **Content Testing**
   - Confirm all battle mechanics are explained
   - Verify completion conditions are clear
   - Check variant selector explanation
   - Validate battle flow steps

3. **Navigation Testing**
   - Navigate to page 2 from page 1
   - Navigate back to page 1
   - Test scroll reset on page change
   - Verify page counter shows "Page 3 of 13"

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Test with keyboard navigation

- Page 4: Card Abilities (7 abilities with descriptions)
- Page 5: Game Sessions (session tracking and completion)
- And remaining pages through Page 12

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `src/client/screens/tutorial/BattleMechanicsPage.tsx`
2. **Modified**: `src/client/screens/TutorialScreen.tsx`
   - Added BattleMechanicsPage import
   - Added page 2 rendering logic

## Visual Highlights

### Battlefield Layout
The interactive battlefield grid is a key visual element that helps players understand the 10v10 structure. The color-coded slots (blue for West, red for East) make faction sides immediately clear.

### Combat Example
The Zeus vs Odin combat example provides a concrete visualization of how slot positions work, with the animated VS indicator drawing attention to the matchup.

### Battle Flow
The numbered step-by-step flow with the final green checkmark provides a clear mental model of the entire battle process from start to finish.

### Completion Conditions
The dual-condition explanation (all slots filled OR 30-minute timeout) is presented with distinct visual styling to ensure players understand both scenarios.
