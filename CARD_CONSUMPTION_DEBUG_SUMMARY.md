# Card Consumption Debug - Summary

## What I Did

You're absolutely right - the logic should be simple:
1. Win card ‚Üí Add to inventory with quantity 1 (or increment if exists)
2. Use card ‚Üí Subtract 1 from quantity (minimum 0)
3. Show collection ‚Üí Display all cards with their quantities

The code DOES implement this correctly, but something is preventing it from working. I've added extensive logging to find out what's happening.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Detailed Logging

**File: `src/server/core/inventory.ts`**

Added logs to track:
- `getInventoryItems()` - Shows raw Redis data and parsed items
- `hasCardVariantAvailable()` - Shows what card is being checked and if it's available
- `removeCardFromInventory()` - Shows:
  - What card is being removed
  - Current quantity before removal
  - New quantity after removal
  - Whether the field was deleted

### 2. Added Debug Endpoint

**File: `src/server/index.ts`**

New endpoint: `GET /api/debug/inventory`

Returns raw Redis data so you can see exactly what's stored:
```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "key": "inventory:your_username",
  "rawData": {
    "101:101-base": "3",
    "102:102-base": "1"
  },
  "fieldCount": 2
}
```

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Current State
Visit: `http://your-app-url/api/debug/inventory`

This shows your actual inventory in Redis.

### Step 2: Use a Card
1. Note a card's quantity (e.g., Zeus has quantity 3)
2. Place that card in a battle
3. Watch your terminal/server logs

### Step 3: Check Logs
You should see logs like:
```
[getInventoryItems] Raw Redis data for username: {"101:101-base":"3"}
[hasCardVariantAvailable] Checking username: cardId=101, hasCard=true, quantity=3
[removeCardFromInventory] Removing card: field=101:101-base
[removeCardFromInventory] Current value in Redis: 3
[removeCardFromInventory] New quantity after decrement: 2
```

### Step 4: Verify Change
Visit `/api/debug/inventory` again - quantity should be decreased.

## What the Logs Will Tell Us

### If you see the logs:
- ‚úÖ The code is running
- ‚úÖ Redis operations are executing
- We can see if the quantity is actually changing

### If you DON'T see the logs:
- ‚ùå `removeCardFromInventory()` is not being called
- ‚ùå There's an error being caught somewhere
- ‚ùå The request isn't reaching the server

### If quantity doesn't change:
- ‚ùå Redis isn't persisting the data
- ‚ùå Wrong field name is being used
- ‚ùå Multiple variants are confusing the system

## The Data Structure

### Redis Storage
```
Key: inventory:username
Type: Hash
Fields:
  "101:101-base" ‚Üí "3"    (cardId:variantId ‚Üí quantity)
  "102:102-base" ‚Üí "1"
  "205:205-alt-1" ‚Üí "2"
```

### Operations
```javascript
// Add card
await redis.hIncrBy('inventory:username', '101:101-base', 1);
// Result: "101:101-base" ‚Üí "4"

// Remove card
await redis.hIncrBy('inventory:username', '101:101-base', -1);
// Result: "101:101-base" ‚Üí "3"

// If reaches 0
await redis.hDel('inventory:username', ['101:101-base']);
// Result: field removed
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run `npm run dev`** to start the server with new logging
2. **Visit `/api/debug/inventory`** to see your current inventory
3. **Use a card in battle** and watch the terminal
4. **Share the logs** so we can see what's happening

The logs will show us EXACTLY where the problem is:
- Is the card being consumed?
- Is Redis updating?
- Is the frontend not refreshing?

## Files Modified

- `src/server/core/inventory.ts` - Added logging to all key functions
- `src/server/index.ts` - Added `/api/debug/inventory` endpoint

## Testing

After starting the server, you can test with:

```bash
# Check inventory
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/inventory

# The logs will appear in your terminal when you use cards
```

Let's find out what's really happening! üîç
