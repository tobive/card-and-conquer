# Lazy Loading Implementation

## Changes Made

Removed card image preloading from all screens and switched to lazy loading with spinners. This provides a better user experience by:
- Not blocking the UI while images load
- Showing content immediately
- Loading images on-demand as they appear
- Relying on browser caching for performance

## Screens Updated

### 1. MenuScreen
- **Before**: Preloaded 90 level 1-2 card thumbnails
- **After**: Only preloads menu background and button images (when available)
- **Benefit**: Instant screen load, no waiting for card images

### 2. GachaScreen  
- **Before**: Preloaded 130 level 1-3 full-size card images
- **After**: No preloading, images load on-demand during reveal
- **Benefit**: Much faster initial load, images load when actually needed

### 3. BattleCreateScreen
- **Before**: Preloaded all inventory card images
- **After**: No preloading, cards load as user scrolls
- **Benefit**: Instant screen load, progressive image loading

### 4. BattleListScreen
- **Before**: Preloaded 90+ card thumbnails
- **After**: No preloading, cards load as battles appear
- **Benefit**: Instant screen load, faster navigation

### 5. BattleViewScreen
- **Before**: Preloaded all battle card images
- **After**: No preloading, cards load as they appear
- **Benefit**: Instant battle view, progressive loading

## How It Works

### Card Images
All card images use the `CardImage` component which already has:
- Lazy loading built-in
- Loading spinner while image loads
- Automatic retry on failure
- Fallback to placeholder on error
- Browser caching for repeat views

### Menu Assets
MenuScreen now only preloads:
- Background image: `/menu-background.jpg`
- Button images: `/menu-button-*.png` (8 buttons)

If these assets don't exist, the preloader completes immediately and uses current CSS styling.

## Browser Caching

The browser automatically caches images, so:
- First visit: Images load on-demand with spinners
- Subsequent visits: Images load instantly from cache
- No need for manual preloading

## Performance Benefits

### Before
- MenuScreen: 2-3 second wait for 90 images
- GachaScreen: 3-5 second wait for 130 images
- User stuck on "Loading..." screen
- Wasted bandwidth preloading unused images

### After
- All screens: Instant load
- Images appear progressively with spinners
- Only loads images that are actually viewed
- Better perceived performance
- Lower bandwidth usage

## User Experience

Users now see:
1. Screen loads immediately
2. Content is interactive right away
3. Card images appear with subtle spinners
4. Smooth progressive loading
5. No blocking "Loading..." screens

## Future: Menu Assets

When you add menu background and button images:
1. Place them in `/src/client/public/`
2. Name them as specified in MenuScreen
3. They'll automatically preload
4. If missing, current styling is used

No code changes needed!
