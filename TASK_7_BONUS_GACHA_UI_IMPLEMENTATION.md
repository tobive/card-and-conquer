# Task 7: Bonus Gacha UI Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the bonus gacha UI system, allowing players to use faction-specific bonus pulls earned from battle victories.

## Components Created

### 1. BonusPullButton Component
**File:** `src/client/components/BonusPullButton.tsx`

**Features:**
- Faction-specific styling (red/gold for East, blue/silver for West)
- Displays available pull count prominently
- Loading state during pull action
- Disabled state when no pulls available
- Touch-friendly button (44px min height)
- Faction-themed glow effects
- Informative text about how pulls are earned

**Props:**
- `faction`: Faction (East or West)
- `count`: Number of available pulls
- `onPull`: Async function to handle pull action
- `disabled`: Optional disabled state

**Styling:**
- East faction: Red gradient (from-red-600 to-red-700) with red border
- West faction: Blue gradient (from-blue-600 to-blue-700) with blue border
- Responsive design with sm: breakpoints
- Animated loading state with spinning icon

## Screen Updates

### 2. GachaScreen Enhancement
**File:** `src/client/screens/GachaScreen.tsx`

**New State:**
- `bonusStatus`: Tracks East and West bonus pull counts
- Integrated with existing pull state management

**New Functions:**
- `fetchBonusStatus()`: Fetches bonus gacha status from API
- `handleBonusPull(faction)`: Handles bonus pull action for specific faction
  - Makes API call to `/api/bonus-gacha/pull`
  - Updates player state
  - Shows card reveal modal
  - Refreshes bonus status after pull
  - Handles errors gracefully

**UI Additions:**
- Bonus Gacha Section (conditionally rendered when pulls available)
  - Section header with gradient badge
  - Grid layout for faction buttons (responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 cols desktop)
  - BonusPullButton for East faction (if pulls > 0)
  - BonusPullButton for West faction (if pulls > 0)
  - Info card explaining bonus pulls system
  - Shows total earned pulls

**Integration:**
- Bonus pulls use the same card reveal modal as regular pulls
- Supports variant reveals with celebration animations
- Error handling consistent with existing gacha pulls
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous pulls

## API Integration

**Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/bonus-gacha/status`: Fetches current bonus pull counts
- `POST /api/bonus-gacha/pull`: Uses a bonus pull for specified faction

**Response Types:**
- `BonusGachaStatusResponse`: eastPulls, westPulls, totalEarned, lastUpdated
- `BonusGachaPullResponse`: card, variant, remainingPulls, player

## User Experience
