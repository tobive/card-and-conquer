# Gacha Cooldown Update: 2-Hour Cooldown Implementation

## Summary

Successfully updated the free gacha pull cooldown from 4 hours to 2 hours across the entire codebase, including all documentation and tutorial content.

## Changes Made

### Core Code
- ✅ `src/server/core/gacha.ts` - Updated `FREE_PULL_COOLDOWN` constant to 2 hours

### UI Components
- ✅ `src/client/screens/GachaScreen.tsx` - Updated header and info text (2 locations)
- ✅ `src/client/screens/tutorial/CardCollectionPage.tsx` - Updated cooldown badge and description (2 locations)
- ✅ `src/client/screens/tutorial/QuickReferencePage.tsx` - Updated reference table

### Documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated pull types and new player tips (2 locations)
- ✅ `GAME_MECHANICS.md` - Updated free pull description
- ✅ `requirements.md` - Updated gacha requirements
- ✅ `src/client/README.md` - Updated GachaScreen description
- ✅ `GACHA_COOLDOWN_UPDATE.md` - Updated documentation file with new metrics

### Specification Files
- ✅ `.kiro/specs/card-and-conquer/tasks.md` - Updated task description
- ✅ `.kiro/specs/tutorial-system/design.md` - Updated gacha costs reference
- ✅ `.kiro/specs/tutorial-system/requirements.md` - Updated acceptance criteria

## Impact

### Player Experience
- **More Engagement**: Players can now pull cards up to 12 times per day (vs 6 times with 4-hour cooldown)
- **Faster Progression**: New players build collections twice as fast
- **Better Retention**: More frequent check-in opportunities throughout the day
- **More Forgiving**: 2-hour window is easier to catch than 4-hour window

### Game Balance
- **Economy Maintained**: Paid pulls (50 coins) and multi-pulls (170 coins) still valuable
- **Scarcity Preserved**: Still requires regular engagement, not instant gratification
- **Competitive**: Free players can compete more effectively while paid options remain attractive

### Metrics Comparison

| Metric | 4-Hour Cooldown | 2-Hour Cooldown | Change |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Max pulls per day | 6 | 12 | +100% |
| Max pulls per week | 42 | 84 | +100% |
| Time to miss a pull | 4 hours | 2 hours | -50% |
| Daily engagement | Multiple times | Frequent | More |

## Testing Recommendations

When testing, verify:
1. Free pull timer displays "2 hours" in UI
2. Countdown timer accurately counts down from 2 hours
3. Free pull becomes available exactly 2 hours after last pull
4. No breaking changes to gacha logic or card distribution
5. Tutorial pages display correct cooldown information

## Files Modified

**Total: 11 files**

### Code (3 files)
1. `src/server/core/gacha.ts`
2. `src/client/screens/GachaScreen.tsx`
3. `src/client/screens/tutorial/CardCollectionPage.tsx`
4. `src/client/screens/tutorial/QuickReferencePage.tsx`

### Documentation (4 files)
5. `README.md`
6. `GAME_MECHANICS.md`
7. `requirements.md`
8. `src/client/README.md`
9. `GACHA_COOLDOWN_UPDATE.md`

### Specifications (3 files)
10. `.kiro/specs/card-and-conquer/tasks.md`
11. `.kiro/specs/tutorial-system/design.md`
12. `.kiro/specs/tutorial-system/requirements.md`

## Rollback

If needed, revert by changing the constant back to 4 hours:
```typescript
const FREE_PULL_COOLDOWN = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 4 hours
```

And updating all UI text from "2 hours" back to "4 hours".

## Next Steps

1. Test the changes in development environment (`npm run dev`)
2. Verify countdown timer displays correctly
3. Confirm free pull becomes available after 2 hours
4. Monitor player engagement metrics after deployment
5. Gather player feedback on the new cooldown

## Conclusion

The 2-hour cooldown makes the game significantly more accessible and engaging while maintaining a healthy game economy. This change should improve player retention and satisfaction, especially for new players building their initial collections.
