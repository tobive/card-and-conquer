# Task 5: Lazy Loading with Visual Feedback - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented lazy loading with visual feedback for card images in the collection screen, providing users with clear loading indicators and error states.

## Completed Subtasks

### 5.1 Create CardLoadingSpinner Component ✅
**Location:** `src/client/components/CardLoadingSpinner.tsx`

**Features:**
- Three size variants: small, medium, large
- Smooth CSS animation using the `spin` keyframe
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Optimized for mobile with GPU acceleration
- Faction-themed colors (amber spinner on slate background)

**CSS Additions:**
- Added `.card-loading-spinner` styles in `src/client/index.css`
- Smooth rotation animation with `animate-spin` class
- Mobile-optimized with hardware acceleration
- Size-specific padding adjustments

### 5.2 Enhance useLazyCardImages Hook ✅
**Location:** `src/client/hooks/useLazyCardImages.ts`

**Enhancements:**
- Added `CardLoadingState` type: 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error'
- New `loadingStates` Map to track individual card states
- Helper functions:
  - `isLoading(cardId)` - Check if card is loading
  - `hasError(cardId)` - Check if card has error
  - `isLoaded(cardId)` - Check if card is loaded
  - `markAsLoaded(cardId)` - Mark card as successfully loaded
  - `markAsError(cardId)` - Mark card as failed to load

**State Management:**
- Automatic state transitions: undefined → loading → loaded/error
- Batch state updates for performance
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Eager loading support with immediate 'loaded' state

### 5.3 Update CollectionScreen with Lazy Loading Feedback ✅
**Location:** `src/client/screens/CollectionScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Integrated loading states from enhanced hook
- Updated `CollectionCard` component:
  - Added loading spinner overlay during image load
  - Added error state display with warning icon
  - Passes `onImageLoad` and `onImageError` callbacks
  - Proper z-index layering for overlays

- Updated `VariantCard` component:
  - Same loading/error state handling as CollectionCard
  - Maintains variant-specific styling
  - Proper overlay positioning

**CardThumbnail Component Updates:**
**Location:** `src/client/components/CardThumbnail.tsx`
- Added `onImageLoad` and `onImageError` props
- Callbacks triggered on image load success/failure
- Integrated with CardImage component's load events

## Visual Feedback States

### Loading State
- Semi-transparent overlay with spinner
- Amber-colored rotating spinner
- Positioned center of card
- Z-index 20 to appear above card content

### Error State
- Semi-transparent overlay with warning icon
- Red "Failed to load" text
- Warning emoji (⚠️) for visual indication
- Z-index 20 to appear above card content

### Loaded State
- No overlay, full card visibility
- Smooth transition from loading state
- Maintains all card interactions

## Performance Optimizations

### Mobile Considerations
- GPU acceleration for spinner animation
- Reduced animation complexity on mobile
- Hardware-accelerated transforms
- Backface visibility hidden for smoother rendering

### Memory Management
- Efficient state updates with Map data structure
- Batch updates to minimize re-renders
- Proper cleanup of observers and state
- Memoized helper functions

## Accessibility

### ARIA Support
- Spinner has `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading card image"`
- Error states clearly communicated
- Maintains keyboard navigation
- Screen reader friendly

### Visual Indicators
- High contrast spinner colors
- Clear error messaging
- Sufficient color contrast for WCAG compliance

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **3.1** - Card images load lazily as they come into view
✅ **3.2** - Loading spinner displayed during image load
✅ **3.3** - Spinner disappears when image loads
✅ **3.4** - Error state shown on load failure
✅ **3.5** - Only visible/near-visible cards trigger loading

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Loading States:**
   - Scroll through collection to verify spinners appear
   - Check spinner disappears after image loads
   - Verify smooth transitions

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Test with invalid image paths
   - Verify error state displays correctly
   - Check error doesn't block interaction

3. **Performance:**
   - Test with 100+ cards in collection
   - Verify smooth scrolling
   - Check memory usage stays reasonable

4. **Mobile:**
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Verify touch interactions work
   - Check spinner visibility on small screens

5. **Accessibility:**
   - Test with screen reader
   - Verify keyboard navigation
   - Check ARIA labels are announced

## Files Modified

1. `src/client/components/CardLoadingSpinner.tsx` - NEW
2. `src/client/components/index.ts` - Added export
3. `src/client/index.css` - Added spinner styles
4. `src/client/hooks/useLazyCardImages.ts` - Enhanced with states
5. `src/client/screens/CollectionScreen.tsx` - Integrated feedback
6. `src/client/components/CardThumbnail.tsx` - Added callbacks

## Next Steps

The lazy loading system is now complete and ready for use. The next task in the spec is:
- **Task 6:** Implement bonus gacha system backend

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- All existing lazy loading functionality preserved
- New features are additive, not breaking
- Mobile-first approach throughout
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
