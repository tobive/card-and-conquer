## How It Works

### Player Experience (Backend)

```
1. Player joins battle
   ‚Üì
2. Battle resolves
   ‚Üì
3. System checks:
   - Get/create player session
   - Track battle participation
   - Award base rewards (coins + XP)
   - Track session stats
   ‚Üì
4. If player won:
   - Add faction points (all-time + session)
   - Check if favored faction won
   - If yes: Award +50 bonus coins üéâ
   - Update Hall of Fame
   - Award bonus gacha pull
```

### Example Battle Result

**Player Session Before Battle:**
```
East Points: 5
West Points: 8 (Favored ‚≠ê)
Battles: 12
Coins Earned: 870
Bonuses: 5
```

**Battle Outcome:**
- Player fights for West faction
- West faction wins
- Player's favored faction: West ‚úÖ

**Rewards:**
- Base: +70 coins, +50 XP
- Faction Bonus: +50 coins üéâ
- Total: +120 coins, +50 XP

**Player Session After Battle:**
```
East Points: 5
West Points: 9 (Favored ‚≠ê)
Battles: 13
Coins Earned: 990
Bonuses: 6
```

## What's Next

### Immediate Priority: Frontend UI

The backend is complete and functional. Players are already earning faction bonuses, but they can't see it yet. The next phase is building the UI.

### Recommended Order

1. **Session State Hook** (1.5h) - Data fetching
2. **Session Stats Component** (2h) - Display stats
3. **Faction Bonus Notification** (2h) - Show bonuses
4. **Menu Integration** (1h) - Add to menu
5. **Hall of Fame Hook** (1.5h) - Leaderboard data
6. **Hall of Fame Screen** (3h) - Display leaderboards
7. **Game Completion Screen** (2.5h) - Session summary
8. **Battle UI Updates** (1.5h) - Show bonuses in results
9. **Migration** (1h) - Existing player support
10. **Documentation** (2h) - Update docs
11. **Testing** (4h) - Comprehensive testing

**Total Estimated**: 22 hours

## Key Decisions Made

### Design Decisions

1. **Session IDs**: Timestamp + random (no uuid dependency)
2. **Faction Bonus**: Fixed 50 coins (can be enhanced later)
3. **Session History**: Deferred (Redis limitations)
4. **Hall of Fame**: Real-time updates (no caching)
5. **API Design**: RESTful with clear endpoints

### Trade-offs

1. **Session History**: Not fully implemented
   - Reason: Devvit Redis doesn't support list operations
   - Impact: Can't view past sessions
   - Solution: Can be added later with different storage

2. **Leaderboard Size**: Top 100 only
   - Reason: Performance and UI constraints
   - Impact: Players below rank 100 not shown
   - Solution: Pagination can be added later

3. **Bonus Amount**: Fixed at 50 coins
   - Reason: Simplicity for MVP
   - Impact: No scaling with loyalty/streak
   - Solution: Can be enhanced with multipliers

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing (Can Do Now)

```bash
# Test session endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/session

# Test session completion
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/session/complete

# Test Hall of Fame
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hall-of-fame?leaderboard=combined&limit=10
```

### Integration Testing (After Frontend)

1. Play multiple battles with same faction
2. Verify faction bonus awarded
3. Check session stats update
4. Complete session and verify reset
5. Check Hall of Fame rankings
6. Test on mobile devices
