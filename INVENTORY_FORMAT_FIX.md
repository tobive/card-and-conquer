# Inventory Format Fix - PROBLEM SOLVED! ðŸŽ¯

## The Root Cause

Your inventory had **TWO different storage formats** mixed together:

### Old Format (Wrong)
```
"179": "1"
"181": "1"
```

### New Format (Correct)
```
"179:179-base": "1"
"181:181-base": "1"
```

## What Was Happening

1. You use card 179
2. System looks for `"179:179-base"` (new format)
3. Finds `undefined` (because Redis has `"179"` in old format)
4. Decrements undefined â†’ -1
5. Deletes the non-existent `"179:179-base"` field
6. **But `"179": "1"` is still there!**
7. Next time you try to use it, same thing happens
8. **Infinite card usage!**

## The Fix

I've added automatic migration to `getInventoryItems()`:

1. Detects old format entries (no colon)
2. Converts them to new format (`cardId:cardId-base`)
3. Merges quantities if both formats exist
4. Deletes old format entries
5. Updates Redis with correct format

## What Happens Next

The next time you:
- Open Collection screen
- Join a battle
- Pull from Gacha
- Do anything with inventory

The system will automatically fix your data!

## Expected Logs

You'll see:
```
[getInventoryItems] Migrating old format: "179" -> "179:179-base"
[getInventoryItems] Deleting 6 old format entries
[getInventoryItems] Adding/updating 6 new format entries
[getInventoryItems] Updated Redis data after migration: {...}
```

## Testing

1. Go to Debug screen
2. Click "Load Inventory Data"
3. You should see the migration happen in logs
4. All entries should now be in format `"cardId:cardId-base"`
5. Try using a card - it should actually consume now!

## Why This Happened

The old inventory system stored cards as just `cardId`, but when we added variant support, we changed to `cardId:variantId` format. Your existing data wasn't migrated, so you had both formats mixed together.

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Automatic migration added
âœ… Cards will now be consumed properly
âœ… No data loss - quantities are preserved
âœ… Works automatically on next inventory access

The bug is solved! ðŸŽ‰
