# Task 8: User Statistics System Backend - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive user statistics system that tracks player progress, battle performance, and gacha activity. The system aggregates data from multiple sources to provide detailed insights into player achievements.

## Implementation Details

### 8.1 Statistics Core Module (`src/server/core/statistics.ts`)

Created a new statistics module with the following components:

#### Data Model
```typescript
interface UserStatistics {
  // Collection stats
  totalCards: number;
  uniqueCards: number;
  eastCards: number;
  westCards: number;

  // Battle stats
  totalBattles: number;
  battlesWon: number;
  battlesLost: number;
  winRate: number;

  // Gacha stats
  totalGachaPulls: number;
  bonusPullsEarned: number;
  bonusPullsUsed: number;

  // Progression
  level: number;
  xp: number;
  xpToNextLevel: number;
  coins: number;

  // Faction affiliation
  faction: Faction | 'Neutral';
  eastPoints: number;
  westPoints: number;
}
```

#### Core Functions

1. **`recordBattleParticipation(username, won)`**
   - Tracks battle participation events
   - Increments totalBattles counter
   - Increments battlesWon or battlesLost based on outcome
   - Stores data in Redis hash: `battleStats:{username}`

2. **`recordGachaPull(username)`**
   - Tracks gacha pull events
   - Increments totalGachaPulls counter
   - Called for all types of pulls (free, paid, multi, bonus)

3. **`getBattleStats(username)`**
   - Retrieves battle statistics from Redis
   - Returns totalBattles, battlesWon, battlesLost, totalGachaPulls
   - Provides default values of 0 for new players

4. **`getUserStatistics(username)`**
   - Aggregates data from multiple sources:
     - Player profile (level, XP, coins, faction points)
     - Inventory (card counts by faction)
     - Bonus gacha status (earned/used pulls)
     - Battle statistics (wins/losses/pulls)
   - Calculates derived metrics:
     - Win rate percentage (rounded to 1 decimal)
     - Unique card count
     - Faction affiliation (East/West/Neutral)
     - Bonus pulls used (totalEarned - remaining)
   - Returns comprehensive UserStatistics object

#### Redis Storage
- Key pattern: `battleStats:{username}`
- Fields:
  - `totalBattles`: Total battles participated in
  - `battlesWon`: Number of victories
  - `battlesLost`: Number of defeats
  - `totalGachaPulls`: Total gacha pulls performed

### 8.2 Statistics Tracking Integration

Integrated statistics tracking into existing game actions:

#### Battle Resolution (`src/server/core/resolution.ts`)
- Added `recordBattleParticipation()` call in reward distribution
- Tracks wins for players on winning faction
- Tracks losses for players on losing faction or in draws
- Called after battle completion for all participants

#### Gacha System (`src/server/core/gacha.ts`)
- Added `recordGachaPull()` to `performFreePull()`
- Added `recordGachaPull()` to `performPaidPull()`
- Added `recordGachaPull()` to `performMultiPull()` (for each card)
- Added `recordGachaPull()` to `performWelcomePull()` (for each card)

#### Bonus Gacha System (`src/server/core/bonusGacha.ts`)
- Added `recordGachaPull()` to `useBonusGachaPull()`
- Ensures bonus pulls are counted in total gacha statistics

### 8.3 Statistics API Endpoint

#### Endpoint: `GET /api/user/statistics`

**Authentication**: Required (Reddit username)

**Response**: `UserStatisticsResponse`
```typescript
{
  // Collection stats
  totalCards: number;
  uniqueCards: number;
  eastCards: number;
  westCards: number;

  // Battle stats
  totalBattles: number;
  battlesWon: number;
  battlesLost: number;
  winRate: number;

  // Gacha stats
  totalGachaPulls: number;
  bonusPullsEarned: number;
  bonusPullsUsed: number;

  // Progression
  level: number;
  xp: number;
  xpToNextLevel: number;
  coins: number;

  // Faction affiliation
  faction: 'East' | 'West' | 'Neutral';
  eastPoints: number;
  westPoints: number;
}
```

**Features**:
- Fetches comprehensive player statistics
- Aggregates data from multiple Redis sources
- Calculates derived metrics (win rate, faction affiliation)
- Returns 401 if user not authenticated
- Returns 500 with error message on failure

**Implementation**:
- Added to `src/server/index.ts`
- Uses dynamic import to avoid circular dependencies
- Follows existing endpoint patterns
- Includes proper error handling

## Data Flow

```
Game Actions → Statistics Tracking → Redis Storage
                                          ↓
                                    API Endpoint
                                          ↓
                                   Client Display
```

### Battle Flow
1. Battle completes → `resolveBattle()`
2. Rewards distributed → `distributeRewards()`
3. For each participant → `recordBattleParticipation(won)`
4. Redis updated → `battleStats:{username}`

### Gacha Flow
1. Player pulls card → `performFreePull()` / `performPaidPull()` / etc.
2. Card added to inventory
3. Statistics tracked → `recordGachaPull(username)`
4. Redis updated → `battleStats:{username}`

### Statistics Retrieval Flow
1. Client requests → `GET /api/user/statistics`
2. Server aggregates data → `getUserStatistics(username)`
3. Parallel fetches:
   - Player profile
   - Inventory items
   - Bonus gacha status
   - Battle statistics
4. Calculations performed
5. Response sent to client

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Tracking
- **Collection**: Total cards, unique cards, faction distribution
- **Battle Performance**: Wins, losses, win rate
- **Gacha Activity**: Total pulls, bonus pulls earned/used
- **Progression**: Level, XP, coins, faction affiliation

### Efficient Data Aggregation
- Parallel data fetching using `Promise.all()`
- Single Redis hash per player for battle stats
- Reuses existing data structures (player, inventory, bonus gacha)

### Backward Compatibility
- Defaults to 0 for missing statistics
- Works with existing players who have no battle history
- Gracefully handles missing data

### Accurate Calculations
- Win rate rounded to 1 decimal place
- Faction affiliation based on point difference
- Bonus pulls used = earned - remaining
- Unique cards counted using Set

## Testing Recommendations

1. **New Player**: Verify all stats default to 0
2. **Battle Participation**: Win/loss tracking accuracy
3. **Gacha Pulls**: All pull types increment counter
4. **Win Rate**: Calculation accuracy with various win/loss ratios
5. **Faction Affiliation**: Correct determination based on points
6. **API Endpoint**: Response format and error handling

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **5.1**: Comprehensive statistics display (collection, battles, gacha, progression)
✅ **5.2**: Accurate statistics based on stored player data
✅ **5.3**: Battle statistics tracking (participated, won, lost, win rate)
✅ **5.4**: Gacha statistics tracking (total pulls, bonus pulls)
✅ **5.5**: Zero states for new players with no history

## Next Steps

The backend statistics system is now complete. The next task (Task 9) will implement the UI components to display these statistics to players:
- User Stats Screen with detailed statistics
- Quick stats display on main menu
- Real-time updates when returning from other screens
