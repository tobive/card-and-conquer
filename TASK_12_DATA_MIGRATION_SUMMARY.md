# Task 12: Data Migration and Compatibility - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive backward compatibility and data migration for the mythological theme update. This ensures existing players can seamlessly transition to the new system without losing progress.

## Implementation Details

### 12.1 Backward Compatibility Layer

#### Player Data (src/server/core/player.ts)

Added `normalizeFactionName()` function to handle faction name mapping:
- Maps `White` → `West`
- Maps `Black` → `East`
- Handles both old and new faction names

Enhanced `getPlayer()` function:
- Already had backward compatibility for points fields (`blackPoints`/`whitePoints` → `eastPoints`/`westPoints`)
- Now also normalizes faction names using the new helper function
- Ensures all old data is properly converted when read

#### Card Data (src/shared/utils/cardCatalog.ts)

Added `RawCardData` interface and `normalizeCardData()` function:
- Handles both `soldiers` (old) and `devotees` (new) field names
- Maps faction names: `White` → `West`, `Black` → `East`
- All cards are normalized when loaded from JSON
- Transparent to the rest of the application

### 12.2 Bonus Gacha Initialization

#### Enhanced getBonusGachaStatus() (src/server/core/bonusGacha.ts)

- Automatically detects if bonus gacha data doesn't exist
- Calls initialization function for new players
- Returns default values (0 pulls) for existing players

#### Added initializeBonusGachaForPlayer()

- Checks if data already exists to avoid overwriting
- Sets default values:
  - `eastPulls: 0`
  - `westPulls: 0`
  - `totalEarned: 0`
  - `lastUpdated: current timestamp`

### 12.3 Statistics Initialization

#### Enhanced getBattleStats() (src/server/core/statistics.ts)

- Automatically detects if battle stats don't exist
- Calls initialization function for new players
- Returns default values (all zeros) for existing players

#### Added initializeBattleStatsForPlayer()

- Checks if data already exists to avoid overwriting
- Sets default values:
  - `totalBattles: 0`
  - `battlesWon: 0`
  - `battlesLost: 0`
  - `totalGachaPulls: 0`

#### Added Migration Utilities

**migratePlayerStatistics(username)**
- Ensures player exists
- Initializes battle stats if needed
- Documents that historical data cannot be accurately reconstructed
- Future actions will be tracked properly

**batchMigratePlayerStatistics(usernames)**
- Allows batch migration of multiple players
- Runs migrations in parallel for efficiency

## Key Features

### Automatic Migration

All migration happens automatically when data is accessed:
- No manual migration scripts needed
- Players are migrated on-demand when they use the app
- Zero downtime for users

### Data Integrity

- Never overwrites existing data
- Checks for existence before initializing
- Preserves all historical player data

### Backward Compatibility

- Old field names (`soldiers`, `White`, `Black`) are supported
- New code works with both old and new data formats
- Seamless transition for existing players

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with old data format:**
   - Create player with `whitePoints`/`blackPoints`
   - Verify they map to `westPoints`/`eastPoints`
   - Check faction name normalization

2. **Test card data:**
   - Verify cards with `soldiers` field load correctly
   - Check faction name mapping in card data
   - Ensure `devotees` field is used in new data

3. **Test bonus gacha initialization:**
   - Access bonus gacha for existing player
   - Verify default values are set
   - Check that data persists correctly

4. **Test statistics initialization:**
   - Access statistics for existing player
   - Verify default values are set
   - Ensure future actions are tracked

5. **Test migration functions:**
   - Call `migratePlayerStatistics()` manually
   - Verify no errors occur
   - Check that data is initialized correctly

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **6.1** - Card data handles both "soldiers" and "devotees" properties
✅ **6.2** - Faction data maps old names to new ones (White→West, Black→East)
✅ **6.3** - Bonus gacha initializes with zero pulls for existing players
✅ **6.5** - Statistics initialize with default values for existing players

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/core/player.ts` - Added faction name normalization
2. `src/shared/utils/cardCatalog.ts` - Added card data normalization
3. `src/server/core/bonusGacha.ts` - Added initialization function
4. `src/server/core/statistics.ts` - Added initialization and migration functions

## Notes

- Historical battle statistics cannot be accurately reconstructed from existing data
- All new actions (battles, gacha pulls) will be tracked going forward
- The system is designed to be non-destructive and safe for production deployment
- Migration happens lazily (on-demand) rather than all at once
