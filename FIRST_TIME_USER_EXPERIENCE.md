### 4. One-by-One Card Reveal Animation

Both welcome pull and multi-pull feature exciting reveal animations:

   - Returns array of cards

2. **`performWelcomePull(username)`**

   - No coin cost
   - Returns array of cards

3. **Updated `getGachaStatus()`**
   - Added `multiPullCost: 170`

- Shows loading state during check

#### `src/client/contexts/RouterContext.tsx`

- Added `'welcome'` to the `Route` type

### API Types

#### `src/shared/types/api.ts`
