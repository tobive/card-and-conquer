# Gacha Card Image Display Implementation

## Overview
Updated the gacha reveal modals to display actual card images using the GameCard component instead of just showing emoji icons.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports
Added GameCard component and CardVariant type:
```typescript
import { GameCard } from '../components/GameCard';
import { Card, Faction, VariantType, VariantRarity, CardVariant } from '../../shared/types/game';
```

### 2. Updated VariantInfo Interface
Made the interface compatible with CardVariant:
```typescript
interface VariantInfo {
  id: string;
  baseCardId?: number;
  variantName: string;
  variantType: VariantType;  // Changed from string
  rarity: VariantRarity;      // Changed from string
  imageAssets: {
    full: string;
    thumbnail: string;
  };
}
```

### 3. CardRevealModal Component
**Before:**
- Displayed emoji icons (⚪ or ⚫)
- Showed card stats in a text list
- No actual card image

**After:**
- Uses GameCard component to display full card with image
- Shows card with proper faction theming
- Displays all card information overlaid on the card image
- Maintains variant info display for alternate variants

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `showDetails` state (no longer needed)
- Removed `getLevelStars()` function (handled by GameCard)
- Replaced card icon section with GameCard component
- Simplified the display structure

### 4. MultiCardRevealModal Component
**Before:**
- Same emoji-based display as single card modal
- Text-based stats display

**After:**
- Uses GameCard component for each card in the sequence
- Shows actual card images with proper theming
- Maintains progress indicator and variant badges
- Consistent with single card reveal experience

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `showDetails` state
- Removed `getLevelStars()` function
- Replaced card display section with GameCard component

## Visual Improvements

### Card Display Features
✅ Full card image with 3:4 aspect ratio
✅ Faction-themed borders and glows
✅ Card information overlaid on image:
  - Card number and level stars (top)
  - Card name and devotees (bottom)
  - Ability and description (bottom)
✅ Variant-specific styling for alternate cards
✅ Proper image loading with error handling

### Animation & Effects
✅ Maintained all existing animations:
  - Bounce-in effect on modal open
  - Scale animation on card reveal
  - Particle effects for alternate variants
  - Glow effects for rare variants
✅ Smooth transitions between cards in multi-pull

### Responsive Design
✅ Card scales appropriately on mobile
✅ Modal remains scrollable if needed
✅ Touch-friendly on mobile devices

## Technical Details

### GameCard Integration
The GameCard component provides:
- Automatic image path resolution via CardAssetResolver
- Lazy loading with error handling
- Faction-themed styling
- Responsive text sizing
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, alt text)
- Performance optimizations (memoization, GPU acceleration)

### Props Used
```typescript
<GameCard
  card={card}                    // Card data
  variant={variant as CardVariant} // Variant info
  size="full"                    // Full-size display (240x320px)
  interactive={false}            // No hover effects in modal
  showStats={true}               // Display all card stats
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Experience**: Card display matches collection and battle screens
2. **Better Visual Appeal**: Real card images instead of emoji placeholders
3. **Variant Showcase**: Players can see the actual variant artwork they pulled
4. **Professional Look**: More polished and game-like presentation
5. **Maintainability**: Reuses existing GameCard component logic
