# Battle Completion UI Fix - October 28, 2025

## Problem

When players navigated to an already-completed battle, the Battle View Screen did not show any indication that the battle was over.

## Solution Implemented

Added battle status checking and completion UI display when loading completed battles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Import BattleStatus Enum
```typescript
import { Faction, CardVariant, BattleStatus } from '../../shared/types/game';
```

### 2. Added Winner Determination Helper
Created helper function to calculate winner from battle state.

### 3. Check Battle Status on Load
Updated `loadBattleState()` to check if battle is completed and show result modal.

### 4. Disable Join Buttons for Completed Battles
Both West and East faction Join buttons now check `battle.status === BattleStatus.Active`.

### 5. Disable Empty Slot Click Handlers
Slot rendering only allows joining on active battles.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- No indication battle is over
- Join buttons visible
- Confusing experience

### After Fix
- Completion modal automatically appears
- Shows winner/draw announcement
- Join buttons hidden
- Clear indication battle is over

## Files Modified

- `src/client/screens/BattleViewScreen.tsx`
