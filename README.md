## üéÆ What is Card & Conquer?

Card & Conquer is a **faction warfare game** where players join one of two factions‚Äî**White** or **Black**‚Äîand compete in asynchronous battles to help their faction conquer the land. Each battle takes place in a Reddit post with a 20-slot battlefield (10 slots per faction). Players place cards from their collection, triggering immediate 1v1 combat with random opponents. When both sides are full, the battle resolves, and the winning faction moves closer to total victory.

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Collect Cards**: Use the gacha system with free daily pulls or spend coins to expand your collection
2. **Start or Join Battles**: Create new battles or join existing ones by placing your cards
3. **Watch Combat**: Each card placement triggers instant turn-based combat with detailed results
4. **Win Wars**: Help your faction reach +6 on the global slider to conquer the land
5. **Earn Rewards**: Gain XP, coins, and faction points to unlock stronger cards and climb leaderboards
