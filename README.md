## 🎮 What is Card & Conquer?

Card & Conquer is a **faction-based card battle game** where every player's actions contribute to a global war between two mythological pantheons. Players collect cards representing legendary deities and heroes, deploy them in strategic battles, and earn rewards based on their faction loyalty and combat prowess.

### Core Gameplay Loop

2. **Choose Your Faction** - Align with East or West based on your card collection
3. **Join Battles** - Deploy cards in 10v10 faction battles with turn-based combat
4. **Earn Rewards** - Gain coins, XP, bonus pulls, and faction bonuses
5. **Conquer the Land** - Push the war slider toward your faction's victory

## ✨ What Makes This Game Innovative

### 1. **Community-Driven Global War**
Unlike traditional card games where battles are isolated, Card & Conquer features a **persistent global war system** where every battle affects a shared war slider (-6 to +6). When one faction reaches ±6, they conquer the land, all players receive rewards, and the war resets.

### 2. **Session-Based Faction Loyalty**
The game tracks your **per-session faction points**, creating dynamic faction affiliation. Your "favored faction" emerges naturally from your gameplay, and winning with your favored faction awards **bonus coins** (+50), encouraging strategic faction loyalty.

### 3. **Mythological Theme with East vs West**
Instead of generic factions, the game pits **Eastern mythologies** (Japanese, Chinese, Hindu, etc.) against **Western mythologies** (Greek, Norse, Egyptian, etc.), creating rich thematic depth with 200 unique deity cards.

### 4. **Card Variants System**
Cards have multiple visual variants (Standard, Golden, Legendary) with different rarities, allowing collectors to pursue rare versions of their favorite deities while maintaining gameplay balance.

### 5. **Triple Leaderboard System**
- **East Champions** - Top players by East faction points
- **West Champions** - Top players by West faction points  
- **Combined Power** - Top players by total faction points

This creates multiple paths to glory and encourages diverse playstyles.

### 6. **Tactical Abilities System**
Seven unique abilities add strategic depth:
- **FirstStrike** - Attack first (70% chance)
- **Reinforcements** - Gain +100 devotees when defending
- **Precision** - Minimum 50% damage guaranteed
- **LastStand** - Deal 1 final damage when defeated
- **TacticalRetreat** - 20% chance to survive with 1 devotee
- **Spartan** - +200 devotees vs stronger opponents
- **SiegeMaster** - +300 devotees in City/Fortress battles

### 7. **Reddit Integration**
Built natively for Reddit using Devvit, battles create Reddit posts with live updates, combat logs posted as comments, and war victories announced to the community.
