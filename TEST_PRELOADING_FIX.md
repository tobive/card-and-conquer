# Testing the Image Preloading Fix

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the app in your browser

3. Open the browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)

4. Navigate through the app and observe the console logs:

## Expected Behavior

### First Time Opening Menu Screen
```
[MenuScreen] Preloading 90 new assets (0 cached)...
[MenuScreen] Preloading complete
```

### First Time Opening Gacha Screen
```
[GachaScreen] Preloading 40 new assets (90 cached)...
[GachaScreen] Preloading complete
```

### Returning to Menu Screen
```
[MenuScreen] All 90 assets already cached
```

### Returning to Gacha Screen
```
[GachaScreen] All 130 assets already cached
```

## What Changed

- Assets are now cached globally across all screens
- Each asset is only downloaded once per session
- Subsequent screen visits are instant (no preloading delay)
- No more repeated "Preloading X assets..." messages for the same screen

## Performance Metrics

You should notice:
- Faster screen transitions after first load
- No loading delays when returning to previously visited screens
- Reduced network activity (check Network tab in DevTools)
- Smoother overall experience

## Cache Management

If you need to clear the cache for testing:

```typescript
import { clearPreloadCache } from './hooks/useAssetPreloader';

// Clear all cached assets
clearPreloadCache();
```

## Browser Compatibility

This fix works with the browser's native image caching:
- Browser cache: Prevents network requests
- Global cache: Prevents redundant Image object creation
- Combined: Maximum performance
