# Bug Fixes: Leaderboard, Statistics, and Hall of Fame

## Issues Fixed

### 1. LeaderboardScreen - `isWhite` Reference Error
**Problem**: The code referenced an undefined variable `isWhite` in three places
**Root Cause**: Variable was named `isWest` but referenced as `isWhite`
**Fix**: Changed all `isWhite` references to `isWest`

**Locations Fixed**:
- FactionTabButton component: emoji display
- LeaderboardEntry component: player name color
- LeaderboardEntry component: faction icon display

**Problem**: No way to navigate back to the main menu
**Fix**: 
- Added `useRouter` import
- Added Back button in header section
- Added Back to Menu button in error state
