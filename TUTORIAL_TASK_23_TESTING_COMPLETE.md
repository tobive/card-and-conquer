## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing Approach

The automated tests focus on:
1. **Component Existence:** Verify all components are properly exported
2. **Structure Verification:** Confirm 13-page structure and page components
3. **Requirements Validation:** Verify design requirements are met
4. **Content Accuracy:** Validate game mechanics and reward values

### Manual Testing Approach

Manual testing is required for:
1. **Visual Verification:** Animations, transitions, styling
2. **User Experience:** Navigation flow, readability, usability
3. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Device Testing:** Mobile phones, tablets, desktops
5. **Accessibility Testing:** Screen readers, keyboard-only navigation

---

## Known Limitations

### Automated Testing

The automated tests verify:
- Component structure and exports
- Design requirements and specifications
- Content accuracy and game values

The automated tests do NOT verify:
- Actual UI rendering (requires DOM testing library setup)
- Visual appearance and styling
- Animation smoothness
- User interaction flows
- Cross-browser compatibility

These aspects require manual testing using the provided checklist.

### Testing Environment

- Tests run in Vitest environment
- DOM testing library not fully configured for complex React components
- Manual testing recommended for full UI verification

---
